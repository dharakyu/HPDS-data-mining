0,big comfy chairs in all directions.,there a minimal tables to spread out and children are left unattended which can be a bit of annoyance.,"the sofa in the magazine area is far from comfortable, but it's not soiled and smelly like you would expect in most vegas libraries.","the decor is not fancy or rustic but rather, reminds me of being in a hostel with wooden chairs, the one beat up couch and a bunch of traveling books and photos around.","and the selection is fairly vast, although they contain noticeable holes in some areas (do they truly need 128 copies of the same horrible dvd [order ten less, and get a couple of arthouse films instead])

when the economy was met at full strength with the great recession, it was arguably a competition between lvccld and north las vegas library systems in regards to who would slash their hours and staff more.",the warm fried things in the window mmmmmmm.,the decor is appalling and the tables were dirty and trash was littered on the floor.
