Applying for ton of adds and etc. Some of it legit, some not. Today one ""lady"" contacted me and invited for a casting right that day. ""oh, well maybe they are in the rush, whatever"" - I thought. I didn't have the right clothing for casting, so I let her know, she said it's fine. ""kkk"" it got fishy when she said I gotta call her, when I reach the address. why is that??? They don't have an office or secretary?! Alright, I still went, to see what's it about. I got there, she never introduced herself nor gave me a name of the agency. I walked in the nice office, but there was no front desk or anything like that. She brought me to one of the rooms, showed me some kinda website of the agency, that didn't contein of anything but photos of girls. And she got forward to the deal/scam. We will put your photos on our website and connect with clients for $100 one time fee, we don't charge % of work you do with clients it's all yours!! Oh, WOW, such a great deal and only $100!!! Sign me in rn!! Like really??? You would consistently connect me with clients without getting paid, applauds!! Whatta angel! Nope! No legitimate agent will ask you money upfront and denies taking a fee if you booked, otherwise it doesn't worth it to them nor they interested in getting work done. She kept rushing with an answer, if I gonna pay, plus they were shooting rn for future catalog. Duh, probably for more buzz and excitement for ""Green"" model. After I said :""no, thank you!"" she looked dissatisfied and showed me the door, there was another girl waiting. After I left I Googled kin spaces, they are legit, BUT it's coworking space and anybody can rent a space there to work even scamers, unfortunately. Be careful ladies!! Your, Velvet cat on the sun",1

I could not be more pleased with their service. I'm a writer, and the coffee shop atmosphere can be really awkward and booking monthly office space is super costly. So, to have the option (with Croissant) of working in different workspaces around the city (and in other cities) on an hourly basis is so much better and much (MUCH) more cost-efficient than booking entire days. So glad I signed up. I would urge other people thinking about it to just go for it -- really -- at least for the trial period. You won't regret it. 5 stars.",5

Your priorities may vary, but it's likely that you're considering staff, physical plant, and 'vibe'.  IS was the obvious choice for us.  We've been Ignited Spaces customers since 2016 and the only changes have been improvements.

IS is really well thought out, and very attractively designed.  The common spaces are well-equipped with a playful feel.  The technical infrastructure is solid.

The co-worker spaces are calm and quiet.  The offices are spacious, offering both privacy and light.  Depending on where you land, the views run from good to spectacular.

The staff is perhaps the greatest feature of the facility.  They are welcoming, gracious, and accommodating.  I am consistently amazed, notwithstanding the limited time that I personally spend at IS, that people know me on sight, remembering my name and company affiliation.  In my experience, technical issues were solved in minutes.

The IS location is terrific, with a first-tier independent cafe on the ground floor and good quality, affordable restaurants within walking distance.  If you are considering co-working space, you need look no further.",5

I learned about Indie Desk through a friend who recommended it to me. I went to learn more and they gave me a FREE day pass. Next day I managed to do more than I use to achieve when I work in a coffee shop. 

They have good facilities, friendly staff and a cool community of freelancers and entrepreneurs. Something unexpected interacting with the community was that I ended up receiving a free advice from an expert: one of the members who is a video producer with more than 10 years of experience gave me advice to complete a video for marketing a new mobile app.

What I love the most about Indie Desk is its community and the location in Downtown LA. Whether I use my bike or take a bus/metro, I don´t worry about traffic anymore or wasting my time commuting.

We came for the great Loop location, fast internet, reasonable prices and cool vibe. But once we moved in we realized that the key benefit for startup companies like us (or satellite locations of larger companies) is the “community”. Starting a business can make you feel isolated, especially after experiencing life at a larger company as most entrepreneurs have. Level Office has a great community! Level staff creates events (lunch & learns, happy hours, etc.) which make it easy to meet other people in the location. We’ve made connections that lead to new business, new partners, and new friends. You also can utilize the other Level Office locations if you have a meeting in River North or West Loop, or even in many other cities nationwide. The Level Office staff seems to know everyone by name which makes the place seem cozy even though it’s pretty big. They also have a nice community app which makes it easy to stay in the loop with Level staff, connect with other people in the building, book conference rooms and never miss an event. We are big fans of Level Office – highly recommended!",5

I was invited to co-work here with a friend a few weeks ago, and was really impressed with the lighting, furniture, and balance between startups and individuals working here. What's unique about this space is that the teams that have offices here often work out in the open area. By the second day, I had already met and talked to at least three different startup groups, which is so rare and wonderful, considering I've been comparing co-working spaces for quite awhile. 

The Herman Miller desking offers generous surface area for spreading out, many convenient outlets, and there are skylights sprinkled throughout the space for a natural daylit loft ambiance. It is pretty quiet now, but I think Space will hit a critical mass soon, especially with groups like the Experience Institute making regular appearances. Get in now while you can!",5

Hosting the shower in my small apartment was not an option and a restaurant just didn't fit into our budget. After an extensive Google search I came across FRO. While it's original intention is to support the needs of workers and entrepreneurs I could see how the owners expanded their scope of services to include advertising the space as a great place to host some what larger gathers. 

After going to FRO for a walk through I knew it was perfect! My 50 guest would be able to enjoy themselves in the spacious, sunny, clean space and there was even the extra bonus of a small outdoor balcony.  

The day of my baby shower everything went PERFECT. I was able to minimally decorate, the FRO staff helped with table and chair set and break down, my guests were all able to easily park on the street and everyone absolutely loved the space. So many people asked me how I found it. 

I would recommend FRO if you are hosting a small gathering, meeting, book club etc. In addition to it being a beautiful space I also have to mention how reasonably priced it was to host my event there. Obviously getting ready for baby can be very expensive.    FRO gave me the opportunity host family and friends in a classy way without breaking the bank. 

Great concept! I'd definitely recommend checking it out!",5

After looking at offices all over downtown, we could not find anything that didn't require an extensive build out or would have involved a shared office space situation.  When we returned from office hunting, our COO grabbed a flyer from the entrance of the building and learned that Novel Co-Working had the perfect space at a reasonable price.  So instead of moving across downtown, we relocated to a different floor.  The space is perfect for our team.  We still have access to the cool co-working space/lounge that Novel Co-Working has, which includes a really fancy beverage machine (makes coffee like a barista) and beer on tap.  I have not had the opportunity to partake of the beer on tap, but it's nice to know that I can invite family and friends to meet me after work, grab a beer and then head out on the town.",5

Initially I started off as a Revolving member but after my membership requirements changed and I needed to leave my items there regularly, I spoke with a Team Member that was happy to help. I was informed that if I upgraded my membership and paid for a desk then I could leave my items around. I was informed about the security cameras that were placed around and one was in the direction of my desk.

Recently my MacBook pro went missing and I verified that it last synced at the office while I was away. After contacting a STATION Team member I found out that their cameras were no longer active since they took them down during remodeling. Turns out the renovations had been complete for several months before the first incident. Unfortunately, the STATION Team chose not to take proactive action and reconnect the cameras and over the upcoming week, other members items came up missing.

The STATION Team would regularly not respond request about info relating to the issues and often required people to find them in person. Many members have had the same issues with the STATION Team relating to the theft incidents.

On top of that, a new accelerator moved in out of nowhere, and several STATION Members had their ""permanent"" desk re-assigned without fair warning. 

It has been a fair amount of time that the STATION Team was supposed to contact building security and give a response about the footage related to the incident but have failed. 

Many current members have become disappointed as well as previous Team Members.

Please factor this into consideration if you plan on looking at a membership.",2

First of all, the energy is very high and infectious. You are surrounded by like-minded people, all of whom are working hard. I seem to get more done here than any of my other offices. 

The staff are extraordinarily nice and always looking to help you. They really go out of their way to make you get everything you need. 

The premises is pretty amazing. I purposely hold meetings here just to show off the glass, the steel and the space. My clients love it. 

Finally, the pricing is very reasonable. The lowest membership $250 a month is steal considering the access, the printing and conference room availability. 

It's for all these reasons that Galvanize has become the gold standard for social work hubs and spaces in Phoenix.",5

It’s set up for my success without the distractions at the other places. 

The staff, from President and CEO Matt Fehling to Director of Entrepreneur Programs Kimberly Roland, welcomed me along with their concierge team, gave me a tour, listened to what I’m up to, supported it and topped it off with delicious bottomless coffee from local nonprofit Cultivate.

I have a place to maximize everything admin for my 24 year matchmaking company SPIES. I set up dates and meet clients in private. If I met them here you’d all want to office here for sure!! 😄♥️

Today I worked on my laptop and used their excellent treadmill desk and knocked out 8200 steps. 

If you’re an Accredited BBB Business, there are offices in the Community Building next door you can reserve free! ignite sparked has two affordable offices open to everyone using the space. 

I love the bright yellow (DryBar yellow) touches and the motivational quotes everywhere. 

The final reason I’m working at the Phoenix BBB coworking space is to be surrounded by a powerful organization that leads with ethics! And fosters entrepreneurship. 

As a matchmaker, everything I do has to be with an ethical eye. I was in the Navy and am from the Midwest. SPIES was a Finalist in the Torch Awards for Ethics with the BBB. When I needed their wise consult this week, they were there for me and my company.

Kimberly Roland explained they plan to keep costs down because as a nonprofit, they are here to serve businesses. And consumers.

Thank you for a great first week! 
And great Wi-Fi.",5

The Yard is a co-working space offering a place for anyone to rent space to not only work but network as well. The building is right near Chinatown/Jefferson area - so lots of foot traffic and slim parking! 

The night I visited was when they were having an art gallery of works by different artists (both local and national) being showcased throughout the space on all the floors. It's a nice touch to exhibit the art in a more real environment - gave the pieces a home.

Outside of the workspace provided, The Yard has amenities such as coffee, drinks, WiFi to list a few. The space really enhances collaboration, and brings creativity to the forefront.

For anyone that needs an area to get work done, network, get their creative juices flowing, etc. this place has all the offerings!",4

Don't tell any of my out-of-town coworkers but I happen to think WeWork Riverpark Tower is our best WeWork location (sorry not sorry). We moved into our suite on February 1 and while there was still some some construction punch list items outstanding and it wasn't without bumps in the road, all items were handled with professionalism and speed by Laura and her team. The resolution of issues vs. the absence of issues is what I rate service received on. By that standard, the service received here is top notch.

 The WeWork Riverpark Tower team (at every level) work so hard to make the experience of working here seamless and do it all with a smile. They love to hear feedback on how things can be improved and they implement the very best ideas. The fellow members and the Community Team come up with great, creative events which makes it a pleasure to come to work on a daily basis.

The design is great - WeWork is know for their design and I appreciate that the latest design also integrates wider hallways to make the entire office feel more open.

I never write reviews but I need to warn others, as the owners are crooks. If I could I would give ZERO stars

Here are a few of the highlights of this place: 

1. Kiss your deposit goodbye...
2. Re-read the contract, because what they say and what is written is completely different, the lease is month to month, but they will randomly change it to yearly if you are not careful.
3. The wall are so thin, I could hear the guy next door sipping his coffee.
4. The office rent is $500- 750 per month, but I over heard neighbor complaining that the contact sent was $1200 per month. they refused to change and where FORCING him to pay and stay 1 year!!! ( LIKE I SAID THE OFFICE WALLS ARE SO THIN)
4. They are always in constant breach of contract -The Internet in the building was consistently slow and unreliable 
5. Only 1 building has a receptionist. My building has no-one...so random people walk around trying to open the office doors. 
6. The package/ mail room is not secure so anyone can take your packages. And even in the main lobby, there is just rarely someone there. Just a screen that dials some random number that no one picks up. 
7. They will access your private office without notice and take things. They took the blinds from my office

861,ChIJ06zmdBK3j4ARUW7KQix-b58,Hacker Dojo,"3350 Thomas Rd #150, Santa Clara, CA 95054, USA",4.5,"Women: ~BEWARE~ This is a TOXIC, Risky & Dysfunctional workplace. It's an extremely difficult space for women to navigate through - let alone work out of. In the picture I posted, notice how there are not many women in the packed room. This is typical. You need to ask yourself: ""Why don't more women visit the Hacker Dojo?"" - ""Why don't the same women return back?"" - ""Why aren't there more female members willing to pay to be part of this workspace?"" After paying to be a member for several months, I actually had to ask myself: ""Why am I paying to be harassed?"" I stopped being a paid member. I would visit on occasion for events & networking. But even doing that was a can-of-worms. Here are my observations after 5 years: The most influential, senior, longest-running members at the Hacker Dojo promote a culture that is hostile & degrading for women. One of the male leaders, John Sokol, once frankly told me: ""It's Bros before Hos"". And that attitude permeates that ENTIRE culture. As a female, be prepared to expose yourself to male-on-female hostility, inappropriate, sexist verbiage and risk yourself to harassment AND ASSAULT on that open workspace. PLUS Critical Fact to Note: Hacker Dojo is open 24/7 and attracts a continuous flow of UNSTABLE, homeless men who sleep in their vehicles & use the facility for kitchen, bathroom, living room, storage & WIFI access. And don't be fooled by the fact that the Board of Directors now includes four women. That has not counteracted any long-standing, ingrained culture there. If god-forbid somebody should treat you badly, don't think for a moment you can complain to female management because THEY DON'T ACTUALLY CARE. This is a resume-building, volunteer role for them to move forward in their careers. They will not be sticking their neck out for you. There is a Harassment Policy posted, but that policy was forced upon the organization from external legal & ethical forces. The community does not embrace or defend the policy. The Board itself violates its own Anti-Retaliation Policy and do not actually follow their posted Confidential Policy.  If you file a complaint, the key male members will eventually know that you complained and you will experience an even MORE hostile environment. And when a male literally ASSAULTS a woman in the open workspace & she calls the police, the key male members will gang-up, in unison & blame the woman for being there in the first place and ""disrupting"" ""THEIR"" workspace. And to avoid legal liability, The Board will shamefully ban the ""Female who Disrupts"" for calling the police - and conveniently sweep everything under the rug. That is pure TWISTED & EVIL. And even more revealing is that the previous Ombudsperson - responsible for reviewing harrassment complaints - left in disgust. And watch out for the Executive Director, Ed Choudhry. Something is wrong with that man. He lacks understanding of women's workplace issues. He is a despicable leader when it comes to this issue & should really be held accountable for his retaliatory actions towards women. But nobody on that Board cares. And this is how it has been at Hacker Dojo for YEARS: ""It's Bros before Hos"". Ladies, please bypass all this extreme trauma & drama. Do yourself a favor & go somewhere else. Do not pay $150/month to be part of community that treats women this HORRIBLY.  We deserve better than this. Silicon Valley is already a tough place for women. There is no need to suffer in a TOXIC workspace. Make it just a little easier on yourself & find those communities where women are appreciated & treated decently. Good luck with your pursuits. 🙏",1

For such a small person, she has amazing strength and knows how to use her arms and hands for the perfect amount of pressure. I highly recommend you see her.

Yesterday, I switched up and got a massage from Will. IT WAS INCREDIBLE! As soon as he started, I could immediately tell that I would enjoy it. I have a hard time finding a massage therapist who knows how much pressure to use and let me tell you, Will had the perfect amount of pressure consistently through out my massage. A quarter of the way through I could feel my entire body was relaxed and the tense muscles in my shoulders had finally been relieved of their strenuous duty. When the massage was finished, I was in awe over how relaxed I really was. I stayed on the bed for an additional 5 minutes just to soak in this feeling of serenity that was so new and foreign to me.

The facilities and spaces are stunning with high quality desks and seating, private meeting rooms that are  easy to self book and manage your own schedule and space needs. Our clients feel at home in our Link space and the meeting spaces provide the perfect foundation for successful brainstorming and strategic planning sessions.

They keep the coffee hot, the wifi on point and often surprise and delight members with snacks and events, speakers, parties on a regular basis. They work hard each and every day to create an authentic community of like minded business leaders killing it day in and day out to drive business performance. At Link, you aren't in it alone.

I’ve hosted small group breakout sessions, board game nights (great and small), happy hours, brunch, and even a three day, multiple venue, conference with Atmosphere serving as my largest venue. The design of both the actual physical space and the furniture allow for SO many configurations, I can’t believe the number of ways I’ve played tetris to serve radically different needs and different layouts. And, I’ve flipped the room from a conference venue to a happy hour in less than an hour…magic! Perhaps the greatest magic of all is that it doesn’t feel like “just a space,” it does as the name suggests, it’s creates an “atmosphere” that permeates all of the events I’ve ever created there.

Being here at Capital Factory has given me more value than I could ever imagine. 

When I first came here in 2017, I'll be honest...my startup was doing well, but it was not making a lot of money. So it wasn't such an easy decision to invest in a space like this. But it has made such a big difference in my day to day life. I FEEL like coming to work. I feel inspired. I know I can meet good people to make my business run successfully. 

Coming here, I knew very little about the tech scene, but I knew that I could meet tech-minded people who can grow my business. Since then, I've partnered with a programmer and a data scientist who have developed tools for my clients to improve their lives. We are currently working on artificial intelligence software that helps my clients write better resumes to land them their dream job.

In the last two years, my company's revenue has 5x'd. And no, I'm not giving ALL the credit to Capital Factory...it takes a $##! ton of hard work and consistency to get there, but sometimes I wonder how far I really would have gone if I had still been working from home. There is something about the energy of this place that makes me want to keep going. 

I need to give a massive shout out to the hard working staff that works here. They are all unbelievable. Not going to exclude anyone because there are too many people that make this place run successfully, but the entire staff is absolutely fantastic. Praise the operations and FRONT DESK team on all floors (1, 5, 8, and 16) because I feel absolutely welcome every moment I step in this place. No matter what they are getting, they deserve a raise.

They refer to their diversity programs but how are those programs really impactful if you can harass people like me and subject them to a clear double standard and furthermore the staff and management not take responsibility?

In the end, since God has blessed me to be an employer, I could have done two things...go take legal action and spend resources and time for something that was a dicey situation or make a bigger power move, move my company and future business to someone else. I chose the latter.

Sometimes, it's best to just take my business elsewhere and in this instance, I got a better situation where I'm paying more money, but that is money WeWork will never get going forward because of how they decided to mistreat me. That perhaps is the best way to send a message.

I also canceled my membership with Wework Gas Company Tower because of how their New York Corporate executive management handled me. See, they lost two accounts and their rival got more money from me and will continue to get more money long term because of how they decided to speak to me.

Be careful about how you treat customers. Not only did I leave but I wound up giving another company even more money in the short term and long term. Customer service does matter and I can hurt them in their pocketbook without filing a lawsuit.

Just because I'm a black business owner doesn't mean that I don't have the ability to make money or just accept substandard service.",1

There was a miscommunication about my team size, but they worked to accommodate us as best they could.  The extra tables were a touch too high given the folding chairs however, and had sharp corners which conspired with the height difference to make extended working uncomfortable.

Warm is the first word that comes to mind. Every woman there was so warm and welcoming--both the team and paying members. I reached out to these gals on Instagram knowing that I would be in town this week and needed a dedicated workspace today. I was worried that if there was no potential of me coming on as a member, they might prefer I not come in. Wrong. No questions asked, they responded quickly and said ""yes, girl! come on in for a free trial day!"" When I arrived, Gracie greeted me and gave me a tour of the space. Nothing was off limits and I could sit wherever I pleased, which was so nice since some workspaces only offer specific desks, have a million quiet zones, etc. I felt so at home instantly. Later, I desperately needed a phone charger and Gracie (shoutout #2, hey girl!!) gave me hers. Everything was spotlessly clean and no detail was left unnoticed. I would HIGHLY recommend this for any woman in Austin--SO wish I lived here. (Writing this review from around the corner at Royal Blue which was a fabulous recommendation made by Haley when I was on the hunt for a snack, She was also SO sweet and helpful.)

Everything was in place by the time we showed up to set up, and the whole night went very smoothly. Can't say enough how much we enjoyed holding our big party there.

I can't speak to all the sides of the buildings, but the side that faces Baptist, gets extremely warm. Around 4 PM it gets up to 81 degrees. Around 6 PM it is around 83-84 degrees. Part of the reason is because they turn off the air conditioning and heating between 5 PM and 9 AM. They keep them turned off during the weekend and which ever holidays they feel like. HOWEVER, you can pay extra to have them turned on.

We asked if there are any issues, or problems because we are a company that will be operating 24/7. We were told no, but I'm sorry this is Florida - how is no AC not a problem nor issue?

If you do decide to use Regus, be sure to keep a close eye on your account, and be quick to ask questions because if an issue goes above the on-site employee's ability it is impossible to get a human being to help.   I am currently MONTHS into trying to retrieve a security deposit for a previous unit, and the only issue they are having is physically sending me the money.  There is no dispute about the charges, only the fact they are not set up to send funds.  Apparently the only option for me to receive my security deposit back is if I fill in an Excel tracker created circa 2002, and then email this old tracker loaded with all of my company bank account information to their accounting department community email address that is shared by at least a dozen Regus employees -- no thank you.

On one of the live calls, when I said I would not be going in to the location for a tour, the man was rude and said ""if that's how you feel, I won't waste any more of your time"" and hung up on me.  I have learned all I need to know about this company, just by trying to get information so I could sign up.  They are clearly not reputable.

Although their offices are a good temporary solution to many business models, the time and energy spent trying to decipher their invoice system, along with the unbelievably atrocious staff at the accounting level and above, makes Regus an option I will not select in the future.  If you do decide to use Regus, be sure to keep a close eye on your account, and be quick to ask questions because if an issue goes above the on-site employee's ability it is impossible to get a human being to help.   I am currently MONTHS into trying to retrieve a security deposit for a previous unit, and the only issue they are having is physically sending me the money.  There is no dispute about the charges, only the fact they are not set up to send funds.  Apparently the only option for me to receive my security deposit back is if I fill in an Excel tracker created circa 2002, and then email this old tracker loaded with all of my company bank account information to their accounting department community email address that is shared by at least a dozen Regus employees -- no thank you.  

Another time I had a client drop off an expensive bottle of scotch to the Regus front desk, roughly $250 bottle, that disappeared.  I contacted Regus about it and no one could care less.

BE VERY CAREFUL. The big issue with Regus always is how bad they treat you when you leave. It's not the local staff it's the corporate headquarters. They gouge you with fees, and crazy charges that make everyone that I have ever met, who's left a Regus, angry and upset. Why they do this is beyond me. Seems like a terrible thing to do to a good customer. But they do it all the time.

 Make sure you read your contract carefully. Do not forget that your contract Auto renews if you do not give them written notice. What happens to many people is their contract gets extended for another 12 months before they even know about it. Then when the conversation comes up they look in their contract and see the clause they never paid attention to previously. They do it on purpose and they do not care that it upsets their customers. 

Their corporate headquarters are run by terrible people. I even had a branch manager that I knew quit because of the unethical things they were demanding that she do regarding pricing and customer charges. They should be ashamed of themselves

Maybe Ensemble and Common Space just cater to different crowds but Common Space is quickly expanding across DFW so they must be doing something right.

April is so thoughtful, kind and is always looking to bring all of the members together in new, fun settings. They have the usual free coffee, breakfast items, snacks, etc. but what I think makes Industrious different is that every Wednesday morning they will cater a local breakfast item. We also do fun afternoon snacks on Tuesdays and Thursday (most time of the time they are themed - Taco Tuesdays, hummus bar, etc.). I would highly recommend in joining!",5

I've worked at various offices across the US and the UK and this was the best office, with the best management and the best co-workers. At the time the job I had did not require me to be physically present at my desk, but I would drive 40miles (one way) just to be amongst some of the most inspiring and smart people (aka other Perch peeps) I've ever encountered! Tracy and Bob make everyone feel so welcome... They are amazing! During my 2 years there I have not met one other member that I didn't like... Everyone is super intelligent, friendly, and most importantly, helpful.. I've gotten advice on so many things that helped me in both professional and personal life. For a person not from Columbus, everyone was super helpful in connecting me with people so I could grow my network, and I know I wouldn't get the same help at other co-working spaces. We had monthly happy hours at local restaurants and bars, the fridge is always stocked with beer and the coffee is amazing (and local!). I highly, highly recommend The Perch.

Our monthly public meetings [that usually include a speaker or other program] are held on Saturdays at 12:00 noon.

The bathroom [which is around the corner on the second-floor hallway] requires a three-digit code to enter [which I can understand from a ""security"" standpoint] but I had been horrified at the end of our meeting to learn that we had been locked into our meeting room [within the Club Level CoWorking suite of rooms] with no means of escape [even to the Club Level CoWorking entrance lobby] unless someone with a computer chip unlocks that door.",3

- The space is amazing. High ceilings. Brick walls. Wood floors. Lots of natural light.

- The location at the NC Music Factory is perfect. It's technically in Uptown so we get the benefits of being in Uptown, but we do not have to deal with so many of the negatives of Uptown. We have free parking and there are ways to get in and out of the Music Factory where you can miss most of the standstill traffic that can make Uptown a nightmare. Plus, the restaurants and bars that share the complex with us are great.

- The fact that it is ""coworking"" and not just an office with a shared entrance. We regularly work with people who have businesses here to make our smaller marketing agency work like a much bigger one. There are graphic designers, web developers, social media experts, photographers, accountants, and lawyers all here working together. There are also several cool start-ups that we know about before anyone else. Plus, we have gotten a lot of new clients since we work in the B2B marketing industry.

Industry Coworking is all the best things about having an office without any of the drama. It's open 24/7, there are conference rooms to have meetings in, there are people to hang out with, there is free coffee, and free water.

1304,ChIJ4YbqdymgVogRvOixStWPuTM,WeWork,"615 S College St, Charlotte, NC 28202, USA",4.8,"Ya know, I hate to be that person... but it's actually quite a myth that open workspaces are optimal. Certainly, some circumstances calling for collaboration benefit highly from such an area, but in virtually no career are people going to collaborate 100% of the time. Sure, they have teeny tiny phone booths which can be used when you really need to hunker down and to do some focused work. But you can't reserve them. Not having a space to myself where I am expected to complete my work has become a real problem for me. There are literally no cubicle type walls whatsoever, all of the walls are made out of glass. My productivity has been obliterated. It's impossible for me to focus. Frankly, I'm considering leaving my job because of it. Sure, it's a trendy place to hang out, if you really want to hang out with your coworkers during non-working hours. Sure, they have free beer and fruit water. They DON'T have a cafeteria. That really sucks. Considering that I'm working smack-dab in the middle of downtown, this means that if I don't want to bring my lunch with me every single day, there are no convenient, healthy, or inexpensive options -  all of which will take precious time away from my lunch hour, simply to access. I'm not just trying to trash this place, I'm still giving it three stars for the good things about it. The best thing about WeWork is the friendly and helpful staff. But I cannot simply give full marks for the things that it does indeed lack. Further, I think WeWork is encouraging a dangerous movement in large-scale companies that are increasingly implementing company-wide open office plans - which I believe they will realize is a mistake - in due time. 

When I first toured the facility, one of the first things I noticed when walking down the hallway - is that it caused everyone to stop what they were doing and look up at you as you walked past. If companies cared about productivity, they might be more aware of studies that show that it takes 20 minutes to fully refocus after that kind of interruption. The pressure from management to complete work in an efficient manner has not reduced in correlation with the ability to do so... and that's a real problem.

*Edit:
It's also kind of interesting that I just put it in a three-star review, and yet Google is still reporting that WeWork has 19 five star reviews and no others.",3

I quit my corporate job to start a small business earlier in 2018. One of my immediate next steps was to find a quality co-working space. I started out by enrolling in WeWork for a couple of months. I am a two-person startup (for now) and was looking for a genuine co-working environment that is primarily full of other boot-strappers like me. In that regard, WeWork was fine (and had all the right amenities) but the environment there felt corporate and a bit sterile for my needs.

I then searched for an alternative workspace and went through a number of alternatives (other Seattle WeWork locations, Atlas, and a few other places.) In the process, I found MAKERS, enrolled with a Full-Time Flex Membership, and have been in love, ever since.

The place is run by an incredibly thoughtful and professional team (Veronica, David, and the rest of the team are fantastic,) who go way above and beyond whenever I have a question or concern. The physical space itself feels authentic, alive, and connects with me. It's conducive to being creative and productive. 

The location on Lenora and 1st is superb. It's incredibly convenient to settle in in the morning, then leave my backpack and physically visit business partners nearby, or host customers in the space. 

I've loved being a MAKERS member for almost half a year now and am looking forward to years to come. 

Thanks, David, Veronica and team for providing such a great startup hub in the heart of Seattle.",5

I like what they are trying to do and have been interested since hearing about the Riveter a few months ago. What I saw of the place did seem nice and the staff that I interacted with were nice. The event that I went to was about sustainability in businesses. Frankly, I felt like it was a bit of a Starbucks advertisement, which was a bit disappointing. There were a couple of other panelists who I felt had so much to share and they had actually started their own businesses. I was disappointed that there was not more of an emphasis on their experience and instead the emphasis was on a corporate giant. Starbucks does great work but the members at the Riveter and the target audience are people much more like the other panelists starting from the ground. Also as a side note, I didn’t see anyone else that looked like me there. While I was not necessarily expecting it, it would have been nice since the Riveter seems to be geared more toward inclusion, but this is Seattle. I might try another event at some point.

All of the locations we looked at had 24/7 access, coffee included, mail service, etc. The defining factor at Novel was the staff.  We tried it for a month, and the staff really took care of our needs.  No suggestion or feedback was ignored.  Since then they have continued to go above and beyond.

1588,ChIJHUmmkNZ4bIcR4ULBsWaTAK4,The Hive on 16th,"403 16th St Mall, Denver, CO 80202, USA",5.0,"Short Review: Best place I've ever worked from and probably the most productive use of my time in years. Far better than trying to work from a coffeeshop and priced reasonably. The open office concept feels like working at a well funded startup with tons of character. Will be working here again.

My stint at The Hive was brief but worth talking about, so here's my long review ...

Convenience and Peace of Mind: I work from Denver for a couple of months out of the year. Usually I would setup shop in a cafe but I really needed a dedicated workspace for my 27"" Thunderbolt, my company's legal documents, and other things I need to run my company. The Hive offered the 24 hour access via keyfob, private floor access, locked office space, lockers for personal effects, and security cameras. 

Location: Right at the south end of 16th, just a skip away from the lightrail station. This meant I didn't need to drive or find parking and reduced my overall commute worries. Access to great food and other amenities was nice to have, deliveries were simple, and this provided a good central hub for meeting with colleagues and business partners.

Amenities: Sweet Bloom coffee and other snacks were included. In addition to those items, they had a conference room and ""phone booths"" for extra privacy. They have an HDTV for displaying presentations and whiteboards for collaborating. All office supplies, including printers, were easy to access and made working.

Ambience: The open office concept isn't for everyone, but I love it. The high ceilings, desk layout, office furniture coordination, lighting, and decor really made the space look fantastic and provided a general feel of wellbeing. With the other occupant's Spotify selections playing all day at just the right volume, it really felt casual, modern, and classy all in one. 

The People: JD, Greg, Brett, Nick, Kevin, Pete, Danielle were all fantastic people to collaborate with, bounce ideas off of, get feedback from, and just share a conversation with. We started ""Thirsty Thursday"" where we kick back and share a drink and chat for 30 minutes. I feel like I have some lifelong friends as a result of my time at The Hive.

The Owners: Lindsay and Jared are awesome. Just a great pair that I look forward to working with again in the future.",5

It's too far downtown and I haven't gotten involved enough to make it worthwhile. They have fun events but SF is a weird place for private clubs, especially the location.",4
1632,ChIJT1AuoKuBhYARVTeMrSCOcyw,The Wing SF,"115 Sansome St Suite #200, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA",3.9,"I joined The Wing the first week it opened, seduced by the impressive build-out at beautiful 115 Sansome. Before committing to a year-long membership, I specifically asked the membership representative if there would be a cap on membership to control volume. They gave me a resounding YES.  I joined The Wing as a place to work during the day when I have to be downtown so rely upon the availability of seating and phone booths.

Eight weeks into membership, it's clear The Wing either lacks or has a faulty strategy about controlling crowding at the facility. The lack of seating (there are women taking conference calls and working on laptops in the beauty room) and squatting in the phone booths far in excess of the hour long limit has made the space not a functional choice to work, and certainly not a reliable place to plan my day around.

Their overly generous guest policy lets members have 2 guests for up to 4 hours each. I don't know what The Wing is thinking, as this encourages the daily population there to swell 2-3x. And still there are representatives touring prospects. This is apart from the fact that following a lawsuit settlement, they are now permitting men to join, which defeats the entire concept and rebukes all members' expectations as to the environment they would experience.

When I voiced my complaint and requested a refund based on the fact that their representations about controlling membership were not true, they suggested that I attend programming events (which are not of interest to me, and from my experience working later in the day, are even MORE crowded) and sent me a copy of the terms and conditions and reminded me of their ""No Refunds"" policy.

I am not a frequent poster, but am extremely disappointed in the level of customer service so am posting this review as a warning to those who may be considering joining.

I also reiterate the other review posted here, in that The Wing policies are nonsensical in that they are punitive to ladies who are willing to pay the company $2500 up front, there are no any refunds available, but if there are life changes for mo-to-mo members, they will cancel membership.",1
1633,ChIJT1AuoKuBhYARVTeMrSCOcyw,The Wing SF,"115 Sansome St Suite #200, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA",3.9,"Great place to network. A bit loud to get any serious number crunching done - Bring headphones. Very beautiful decor, lots of entrepreneurial women, conveniently located",5
1634,ChIJT1AuoKuBhYARVTeMrSCOcyw,The Wing SF,"115 Sansome St Suite #200, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA",3.9,"Agree with Laura.  The place gets absolutely packed, and therefore loud.  If you're planning on using The Wing for work, I recommend looking elsewhere.  There are a few phone booths for calls, but they're always full of people who seem to park there, despite signs limiting time to 1 hour.  And there is nowhere quiet to go between the music (not ambient, mind you) and chatter.  The other day I joined a conference call from the main room as there were no phone booths.  After the call, I received a frustrated call from my boss saying it was ""way too loud"" in the background and it made it extremely difficult to have the call, despite the fact I was on mute when I wasn't talking.  
If you get up later in the day... maybe to get a drink or go to the bathroom... you can either leave your stuff where it is and trust no one will touch it, or you can bring it with you and likely lose your spot and then have nowhere to sit.  Morning are OK though.
You should also make sure you're asking all the right questions re fees before joining.  For some reason, I was not told that there would be a $200 initiation fee (fine, whatever) and that the conference room fee was $70/hr (not fine that I wasn't told) so I incurred $340 in unexpected costs in my first 48 hours.  But again, fees aside, my biggest issue is that it's packed and loud and not conducive to productive/work atmosphere.",1

The cost effective services in no way will diminish your client's expectations as the conference rooms and reception area are immaculate, and project a very professional image.  

Booking meeting spaces is extremely intuitive through the online portal.  Moreover, in the event there is a client that can only visit at a certain time, the staff will do their utmost to insure that your need is met.  

Further, our law practice relies heavily on the on demand executive assistant services.  The administrative assistants are all capable and professional, and they free professionals such that billable hours are better spent.  Our office uses these assistants for dictation, word processing, editing, and  mailing and shipping.  We further use them for scheduling client intakes and maintaining client relations through status updates.  Our practice is much more efficient with the ability to pass the mundane tasks off.

What stood out the most was that I parked across from the Passport Agency and then handles business for a trip I am taking. I looked up what co-working spaces where available and this space offered a $20 day pass. It's a match. I check directions to the place and I've literally wandered my way to the front door in a matter of 60 seconds. The space is amazing and the staff was fantastic. My one suggestion would be to soundproof the telephone booths better. Much better. I had not utilized a phone booth style meeting room before and thought that it would be my favorite part. Even with the sound troubles, there were other spaces to meet in with privacy. Moreso the tiny sense of community was something I really miss about working on location and I felt like this place had it. I'm quiet and a bit of a wallflower however it was apparent given the collaboration I witnessed.

1941,ChIJIWR6WgAKlVQRa_ze32cWSBk,Collective Agency Downtown,"511 SW 10th Ave #1108, Portland, OR 97205, USA",4.4,"I have been a member of Collective Agency for eight months (since August 2018). I work from the Downtown office, and I highly recommend it as a productive, cozy workplace for freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.

Here are a few reasons why:

Location: I have found the 10th Ave. location to be a real asset. There are food carts right across the street. It is a short walk to Target, Whole Foods, Pioneer Place, and Powell’s if you need to run an errand. Walking to the waterfront makes for a nice break from work. 

I’ve had meetings with people in all five(!) quadrants and have easily been able to get to these meeting via public transit from near the office. 

Bonus: Need a dentist? This building is chock full of them (I got a filling and was back in the office in less than an hour). 

Ambience: Alex, the owner, takes great care to make the Collective Agency offices as comfortable and inviting as possible, using warm lighting, carefully controlled room temperature, art and textiles, etc. He’s constantly making improvements and solicits feedback on these improvements. Plus, the view is beautiful. 

Amenities: Pretty much anything you could think of that would make for a productive office is already at Collective Agency. That includes ergonomic chairs, computer monitors, printers, chargers of every variety, a paper cutter, screen cleaner, batteries, first aid kit, and so many other things—seriously, if you need it, it’s probably there. 

There’s a great selection of coffee and tea and tons of kitchen supplies. There are lockers to keep your stuff, a nice library of books, and even a telescope. There are small rooms that can be used to take private phone calls or meetings, and larger rooms are also available to reserve in the building if you need them. There’s a shower on the first floor if you want to take an exercise break or bike to work. 

People/Community: Collective Agency is a place where you can be very productive, in part because the cozy ambience and ample amenities leave you free to focus on work but also because of the other members. People work hard here and are passionate about what they do, and that can be contagious. 

While it’s often pretty quiet, there are lots of opportunities to get to know your coworking coworkers (if you choose—everything is optional). That includes weekly meetings, eating lunch together, going on walks to the farmers market or to get ice cream, and events like happy hours, game nights, grilled cheese brunches, bowling, and even a book club (my favorite). I’ve really enjoyed getting to know people here. It’s useful to be able to talk about the benefits and challenges of remote or freelance work (or starting a business) or just to have those water-cooler conversations you have in a typical office. When I worked at home I often felt isolated and lonely. I can honestly say that coworking at Collective Agency has been a boon to my mental health.

I may sound like a total shill, but I think others should know about about this gem of a community!",5

As a freelancer, I was looking for a space that would give me an opportunity to meet other working professionals, participate in social events and not break the bank. Collective Agency checks every box on my list. 

As a member, it feels like my opinions matter. There are weekly group meetings to talk about the space, events, etc. and Alex (the owner) is always available to chat if needed. It truly feels like a 'collective' where members are valued and appreciated. The many social events provide an opportunity to get to know the other members and the book club is always a hit. It's great to have people to eat lunch with again. 

The amenities are great. Indoor bike parking, showers, and all the basic office kitchen offerings make this space super functional. And you can't beat the location... it's surrounded by restaurants, coffee shops and stores. As a bike commuter, I especially appreciate the bike shop on the ground floor. They saved me from a flat tire, and provide any service you could need for your bike.",5

I commented more than once that I wish I had an office half as cool as this. The wifi was always fast. We did have some issues when using the Apple TV but that could be our computers too. The meeting room was a comfortable fit for 16 people for long lectures every night.

Each client receives a designated amount of work-space and access to meeting rooms depending upon the plan they choose.  Clients are responsible for putting out educational material on making a successful business (or non-profit) that Hatch then uses to help educate other members.  Hatch works with local banks and investors to educate them on the benefits of investing directly into local businesses.  These investors are then connected with their clients and either receive a portion of the business or repayment with interest in exchange for the funds they invest.  In short a potential client would see Hatch as a place they can get support and education on turning their idea into a business as well as help getting local direct investors into their business.  They work with for profit and non-profit businesses but they do have a couple of requirements.  It must be in the business strategy to remain local.  They don't want start-ups that get an idea going planning to sell out to a national or international firm.  Second the business must be one that creates a positive footprint in the community.  That is entrepreneurs who bring a goods or services to market not resource depleting businesses like oil or natural gas firms would be.  The place has a good vibe and friendly atmosphere and is a viable choice for someone wishing to start their own business.",4

That said, the phone booths are really frustrating if you're a bigger person or use a mobility device; would really be better to have small, one-person conference rooms for the sake of accessibility.

The first week of July we received the initial invoice for the ongoing service to begin in August.  But now, after a number of years at the Regus office they had included a security deposit with our fees equal to a month of service.  The issues with us and contractually are:

1.	There was no mention of a security deposit when Regus presented our new contract in May, either in writing or verbally;
2.	Had we been informed of a security deposit, after several years as a client, we would not have signed a new contract to continue with Regus and would have terminated their services in May, a full 3 months before our current agreement was to expire;
3.	As soon as the invoice came in with the additional, non-contractual charge, we immediately sent a letter of termination; and
4.	Regus, with the addition of this fee that was not presented at the time of the renewal contract had breached the upcoming contract, therefore making it null and void.

Since terminating our agreement with Regus we have received ongoing invoices from them, with late charge fees.  We have not only contacted their local office, but the office of the CEO of Regus USA in Dallas, Texas, to no avail.  We have offered, as their contract states, to go to arbitration to settle the dispute and have agreed to abide by the decision of that arbitrator.  Regus apparently does not wish to use these settlement services, which would force them to abide by the arbitration decision, even though that is the remedy for disputes as outlined in their own contract.  Instead they have now turned the disputed amount over to a ‘COLLECTION’ agency, with their target being the CEO of our company.  Could this possibly be perceived as being done this way for any other reason than to have an individual harassed?  We are a “C” corporation in the state of Nevada and the Regus contract was with the corporation, not any corporate officer individually.",1

Collaboration in the conference room helps my coworkers and I complete tasks together efficiently. The sense of community throughout the whole building is also a plus, considering there are happy hours every first Thursday of the month and the occasional barbecue on the outside patio.

2292,ChIJJRMw0ecEyIkRwxzipN6_mBQ,Charles Village Exchange,"2526 St Paul St, Baltimore, MD 21218, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA",4.5,"I've worked at the Charles Village Exchange for the past year now. It has been a great experience so far, both in office ambiance, location, perks and the price for a space is comparable to other co-working spaces in Baltimore. 

The office space itself is in the third floor of a renovated row home, which has been upgraded and revamped to have a modern feel. Inside, there are 7 half walled cube spaces with ample room in each space to set up your desk area as you see fit. It has all your basic office amenities like coffee, water, fridge, and full bathroom. In addition, you can be as collaborative or as heads down as you need during the day with the other workers in the office space. In general, the office is also pretty quiet except for the occasional train that passes by outside the window, but that’s not a big deal.

I think the biggest perk is the location. Nestled near many nice Baltimore neighborhoods like Charles Village, Remington, and Hampden, you’ll find ample options for coffee, lunch, happy hour and dining out.

If I had to nitpick, the only tricky aspect or working here is parking. There are no assigned spaces in the back lot for Exchange employees, so we have to park on the street, usually on 25th street right around the corner, or on St. Paul street out front, if you’re lucky. I usually find parking a little more difficult when school is in session. There’s an elementary school on the adjacent block so those spots on the street fill up pretty quick. While it’s not deal breaker, it’s something to keep in mind.

Lastly, if you’re on the fence about signing up, contact the owner/manager Eve Austin. She’s the nicest person to deal with and can give you a tour of the space at your convenience and can accommodate almost any request.",5

Was a builder level member for approximately nine months. The shop staff are somewhat illusive and have (in my opinion) mediocre customer service skills. They are frequently MIA or occupied by their own projects. I feel that they do not enforce fair shop etiquette standards. Sometimes members monopolize the table saw for hours or occupy valuable shop space with large projects left overnight.          

Woodworkers should know that hand held tools experience a lot of hard ware and tare. Drill and router bits are frequently missing, dull, and/or broken. Hand saws and chisels are often dull. Orbital sanders are used hard and often improperly cleaned from previous use. 

All things considered, it is still a really great value. The weekend hours are especially nice compared to other maker workshops.

I work from my home office and our company also utilizes a ""virtual"" office. Unfortunately after 5 years, we became unhappy with our current location and were excited at the possibility of moving to Hudson Business Lounge after seeing the space and reading the reviews. 

I spoke with Scott in February wherein I explained everything we were looking for and was told repeatedly that this was something they could accommodate. I was provided with prices, hours, availability, etc. Excited to hear what awesome services they provide and anxious to move our business forward we terminated our current lease and contacted Hudson again to officially make the move. Scott remembered our conversation, asked when we would be needing to start our lease and advised they were able to start August 1st. He asked I email so we may discuss further. I did and again reiterated our needs including photos. 7 days went by without receiving any sort of response. I emailed again. No response. Our emails are tracked so I knew they were received and read. I again contacted Scott and he said they would be getting back to us shortly. Today I receive the following email: 

Hi Sara -

I received your note via Scott, and wanted to give you a shout!

Unfortunately, and at this time, Hudson would not be able to accommodate this type of arrangement.

Thanks for thinking of us!
Nick

-----

Obviously, this was shocking to read. Especially without an explanation or at the very least an apology for not only making us wait 9 days to receive this news but for the miscommunication to begin with. 

Emails that followed only provided excuses and basically said ""good luck finding something else!""

Utterly disappointed and disgusted by how this was handled. Hudson Business Lounge states they are for helping small businesses but they are absolutely not and my experience, unfortunately, proved that. 

If you are also a small business owner STAY AWAY from Hudson. They may promise you the moon and stars to get your initial interest but know they may pull the rug out from under you. Their words mean nothing.",1

Wifi was reliable and fast. I often need a hard line internet connection to ensure reliable bandwidth for my work for video conferences etc but the wifi here was never a problem regardless which part of the space I was in. 
After hours access to the space for members was quick and easy. 
Lots of restaurant options within a few blocks for lunch, and local tap rooms for after work happy hours.

Their standard agreement--a long legal document--includes a 12-month automatic lease renewal. Had we known it was buried in there, or had they bothered to contact us before it renewed, we would have canceled, as we had rented a traditional office the same month the lease expired. We tried to work something out with multiple layers of management. The area manager,  Zachary Clark, said he would ""see what he could do"" upon meeting with his regional manager, but he never followed up with us. Requests for an update were met with silence. The whole experience was very frustrating. If you're looking for office space in Albuquerque, I would encourage you to pursue other options. In practice, at least, Regus is a bureaucratic monstrosity that doesn't care about its customers as individuals, only numbers on a P&L statement.",1

We didn't find out until we signed an agreement for a new traditional office at what we thought was the end of our lease.  We called to let them know we were not renewing and they informed us that we were locked in for another 12 months.  We tried to talk to several managers, but they were completely unhelpful and unresponsive. The area manager,  Zachary Clark, said he follow up with us after talking to his manager, but we never heard from him again. We requested update but never heard back.  Very unprofessional.

Regus has always been my go-to, simply because no other office provider offers as much as they do. However In the past there were some communication issues at this location which I think effected their service overall. I looked into a number of the different providers in the area over the course of a few months, although some were nice, none of them could offer the amenities that Regus does. 

Looking back at them now I have to say its like a completely different environment. The new manager Yvonne has not only brought things back to the standard I grew to know, she has exceeded it. She seems to have a lot on her plate getting things in order, however she is always responsive and helpful whenever anything is needed.

I will start by saying, the staff here are great and I have no issues with them. My problem is with the  Regus accounting and billing regime who are not willing to do any customer service. They treat you like dirt and talk down to you like you are nothing. I have a problem every October at lease renewal.  They charge extra months rent when I already paid my retainers then they refuse to refund the money and tell you that you just don't have to pay rent next month. Really? It's ok to keep a client's money hostage but if were a minute late on rent they charge a late fee. This year at renewal they did the same thing. Charged an extra month and charged for internet which was also included in my lease. My lease agent himself contacted accounting and clarified that the invoice was wrong. Accounting told me it will take a few days to be resolved. I called almost everyday and was told to wait it out. It was resolved on.10/12 and I was told to make the payment then for the correct amount. Guess what, now they charged $73 late fee and i am being told (talked down to and treated like dirt) by every representative that they will not reverse the fee because I was late? I gave in and paid it to avoid other late fees on the late fee. I am filling a formal complaint with the Arizona Attorney General's office and the better business Bureau since i can't resolve this issue in a civil manner with them. I am not trying to bash the company but this is my true experience. Take it how ever you want. Will be seeking court actin to terminate the remainder of the lease.

Also, my phone had a really bad LTE connection, and their WiFi didn't work properly on the phone, like, at all.

So here I was after scheduling and arranging for 4 hours at the 3-D printer and having both Michelle Sheppard and Laura Royal standing there looking at me.

While the building looks plain from the outside, I was blown away by the interior. The interior is defined by a two story tall large central room, with plenty of natural light. The desks and chairs are new, modern, and comfortable. There's no shortage of outlets, and usb charging stations, and the wifi has always been fast. Free parking is available around the building, but in the rare event that I couldn't find a space, there's a very large nearby parking lot. When it was time for a break, I would clear my mind by watching koi swim in the indoor pond (the running water also provides nice white noise that drowns out other office noises). The building is situated on a campus with a large grass open space and tall trees. There's also a basketball court and a set of pull up bars, which I've found have been a great way to get the blood flowing and re-energize after being stuck on a hard project. The workshop staff are also great. They're friendly and have always attended to my concerns quickly. Nothing but the best things to say about them. And finally, their prices are very competitive, especially considering what you're getting. I almost always prioritized function over fashion, but here you don't have to.

I began working by telecommute in early 2014 and midway through the year my employer and I both agreed that having access to an office space would be great for my productivity.  I found Capsity online and met with Jeff and Brian and they showed me Capsity.  

At first, Capsity provided me with just another place to work and focus besides my home.  Once I began meeting the other members, though, I began realizing the unique benefits that working at Capsity provided.  I could talk freely to other freelancers, entrepreneurs, nonprofits and business owners about their jobs while answering questions for anything related to digital marketing.  If there is one thing that I love about Capsity, it's the diversity of of the people that work there.  We have digital marketers, nonprofits focused on urban gardening and community innovation, lawyers, architects, public speakers/motivators, and more that I continually get to meet.

I moved to Sacramento in early 2015 not knowing a soul within 100 miles. Brian, Jeff, Mai Linh and the whole crew welcomed me like family. Their generosity and kindness astounded me and continue to inspire me. This extended past entrepreneurial support to mental and emotional support - something that so often goes overlooked in the entrepreneurial community.

My husband, too, rents a dedicated desk, so I get to experience Industrious from both sides.

The Ponce City Market location is excellent.  The atmosphere is professional, clean, and intentional.  The style of the space is beautiful and interesting.  There are often fresh flowers at the reception desks and in the kitchen areas.  There are rent-able offices avaialble, open office available for meetings of tenants, open coworking spaces, areas just for dedicated desks, and 1-person ""phone booth"" rooms tenants can use for a private call.  

Other amenities include a mother's room for nursing, a kitchen space with dish washers, microwaves, and lots of snacks, pastries, coffee, loose leaf tea, fresh fruit, infused water, and healthy bars.  The spread available to tenants really is impressive.

Most of the walls between rented offices are glass, which allows the natural light to come into the entire office space and keep the place feeling energized.  Industrious has weekly happy hours and other events.  Tenants can take advantage of the PCM discounts in the restaurants and shops below.  There is also parking available ($150/month), though I'm not sure how many spaces would be free at this time.

And then our door lock broke. So basically anytime I needed to even go to the bathroom, I had to bring my wallet/laptop/phone with me.

I emailed the front desk about this three times before anyone did anything. I went downstairs, the front desk just kind of shrugged their shoulders and went about their day. Told me they put a work order in. Finally by day four I was livid and was not able to LOCK our DOOR when I was leaving at night, so had to pack anything I needed. I was given the Operations directors email. Emailed her, nothing. I finally had to reach out to our sales rep, who was the only part of this entire ordeal who seemed to have any idea what he was doing. He was able after 4 days step in and move us. We were told it would be months before they could fix the lock b/c it had something to do with the wall.  So I asked if we could be moved to another office where we wouldn't have to move AGAIN a month before our lease was up. They obliged and as a ""Courtesy"" waived the move fee. Umm, your door is broke. You shouldn't even have brought up a courtesy fee. 

I was told by their ""outsourced ""tech"" team that my brand new apple wasn't compatible with their printers. (So every time I had to print something I had to leave the building to pay for it at a Kinkos, which is literally half the reason I rented office space)  

I signed up and paid for parking and was told it was fine until seven days in was told the building lot was full and they forgot to process my paperwork. I had to pay to leave the building four times while this happened, and was charged to my account. So as this was happening, I paid for not only a monthly parking fee, but to exit the building when they screwed up. So it was also delayed and they just charged me for it, I sent an email asking them to remove the charges. And they just didn't respond. So i got charged an exit fee, that I point blank asked if it existed when signing this lease, was told no. And then found out it did. 

Here comes the kicker. We left on 5/31, and were told that our deposit of 1K would be returned within 30 days. I emailed around 6/10 asking ""hey is there an idea of when this would process"" I got a response back from the front desk saying that it wouldn't even be touched until after 30 days past the lease end. Which meant after 6/30. I said, no that's not what is in the terms or what was said. I was told within 30 days. The response was ""Hi Leah,The retainer refund process takes a minimum of 30 days to complete from your agreement's end date which was May 30, not your move-out date. The retainer is still processing and will return to your bank institute of choice after June 30.""

So what you're saying is it won't be within 30 days, and basically I can't even get an answer until after 6/30. I responded, no that's not what is in the lease agreement, it is within 30 days, by GA law you're required to get it to me within 30 days. I asked AGAIN for the third time to speak to someone above this person, and now still haven't heard a word.  He then responded to my email with the highlighted rule staying it was due within 30 days. I still have no clue what is going on or when we will see our deposit, but as a small business it is imperative that i budget/ plan. Never again.",1

I started with a 2/4 month contract deal with them. As soon as I did, I never got a bill for the amount I originally signed for. $600 or so per month. My first bill was like $1,800 or so. They claimed that I never paid my first month. Might I add you’re required to pay your first and last month to even receive a key to your office space. But when I got my first bill they claimed that I never paid the first months fee... in addition I had to pay my next months charge. So I bit the bullet and paid almost $2,000 to settle the debt. Ok let’s fast forward through months and months of irregular charges. I decided to leave this business after going a few months on a month to month agreement. One stipulation is once you leave without notice you loose your deposit. The first and last month. Which is more than fair!! They’re running a business and I get that. But after expecting to only be liable for the first and last months rent. Tell me why their lawyer contacts me and tells me I owe them $9,000!!! So now we might possibly have to settle this issue in court. From the way that it looks to me. This brand grows there business by stepping on the little guy and demanding money from shady contracts. I think their contracts auto renew. So I think they’re trying to charge me for a auto renewing contract after I had already left, mailed in my keys, and cleared out my office. Be very careful with this shady company. Worst experience of my life. Go with We Work, Industrious, or someone like that. RUN, RUN, RUN!!!!! FROM THIS BUSINESS!!!!!",1

As a smaller company we value energy, space, amenities (coffee, call rooms, meeting rooms, parking), and support which ROAM has delivered over the past 3 months we've been a member. Location wise, ROAM Buckhead is smack dab in the middle of the tech mecca that is Piedmont and Lenox road, walkable to gym's, grocery stores, and restaurants. If you need space for face to face meetings, you can rest assured that the meeting rooms at ROAM are all incredibly modern and outfitted with all the technology accessories. All of this combined with the fact that they are more affordable than many of the other local co-working options makes ROAM a great contender for any company that is looking for this type of space.

Last but not least, I want to personally thank Caitlin, Bret, Lee, Mallory, and Stephen for making our experience at ROAM so enjoyable. If you're in the market, I would highly suggest taking a look at ROAM first so you can compare it to the other options appropriately.",5

Great environment, fantastic design, intelligently created work spaces, and an involved community that they have generated with all the companies there. Powerful events and seminars are hosted every week there.

We are extremely satisfied with StartHub, and would recommend its office spaces as one of the best in the area! Great Space, Even Better Team!

The space is beautifully designed and the coworking experience is very unique, with amazing energy, activities and especially people! Everyone in the space is super creative, mindful and highly motivated. It's definitely a great place where you get work done, accomodate your clients and also for other wellness activities to decompress after a long day at work.

We were looking to augment our team at our Miami location, and thus needed a space asap, that would both make our new employees happy while being productive. The location in the heart of Midtown Miami is excellent, Tedge is well connected to any part of Miami, and it's surrounded by many great restaurants, fitness centers, cafes, bars etc. 

I really like the ""alternative"" focus of the space with an emphasis on productivity, wellness, yoga, etc., all in one place, that we find great to accommodate us and our clients, both for working mode and when you want to relax or take a ""mindful break"".

Needing 45-60 minutes to set up, this is a problem for a 9am depo. Conference rooms are adequate in size and not too hard to set up in.

Parking can be difficult at the Aksarben Village location, but arriving by 8:20 isn't too bad. Once I had an afternoon job and had to park at the top of the parking structure (which has an elevator) to the southeast and that caused quite a trek with the equipment cart from there to the building with the Regus unit. There is a long stretch (approx. 500') from structure to building without cover, so had it been raining, this would have been very bad! But the parking there is all free.

Downtown Omaha Regus has a slightly better parking option, but it's still always quite a trek thru 2 elevators and over a city block of pushing, but all under cover of inclement weather. And that building forces you to use a freight elevator, even with a small equipment cart, which usually adds 2-3 minutes on getting up to their floor, vs. the standard elevator. They don't validate, so parking costs.

3128,ChIJxckfYLGAj4ARN6moJES_zZk,Impact Hub Oakland,"2323 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94612, USA",4.7,"Really really disappointing from a social perspective. Almost no one talked to each other or really barely acknowledged each other. The group salad meals on Friday were the one exception to this. But, in general, I'm amazed how few people I actually interacted with. It took me leaving the bay and finding amazing socially-nourishing coworking spaces in Berlin and Oaxaca, MX to realize just how bad the impact hub oakland was [for me].

The space is nice and really, many of the staff were nice and did their best. But there's something just really off in the vibe at this coworking space. I think it could be because it tries to mix social justice goals with coworking goals (it's really unclear if it is a coworking space, a social justice project, or a business accelerator...)...It could be because Oakland is changing/gentrifying/displacing so much and this tension is felt acutely here. It could be because the new bay area startup people are kind of lame. Could be because everyone is working too much/hard in the bay. Could be the impact hub doesn't have enough events. And also could be that I look for a totally different thing in a coworking space than most.

For the record, I also tried the port to no avail.

I think the biggest thing that disappointed me is just how far this place felt from its potential. When I first got to Oakland and this space, I was imagining the chance to connect with all these different sorts of people and for people to be collaborating and helping eachother with their projects/work. To have a place just down broadway that I would feel welcome to work out of. And to hit all sorts of unique/mind-expanding events.

I ended up opting for coffeeshops instead. I actually felt less lonely working at Arbor, Lucky Duck, Farley's east vs. paying to feel even lonelier at the impact hub.",2

They are determined to solve any wordpress problem. On Wedneday and Fridays there is  Wordpress meeting. The session allows each participant to introduce yourself to the group, and the reason, or the type of support you need.. Then the group breaks into smaller groups, each with an assigned expert. For the remaining 45 minutes the expert helps each individual participant. It's better than having a technition only work on your issue, and less expensive.  There's much to learn looking at other people's problems, and how they are resolved. My web page is much better than it would be if I was not a member of Tech Liminal. I highly recommend them.

The location is great and the team works hard at developing community.   Those are the pluses.  However, there are a couple fairly big negatives, such that I would think twice -especially if you are looking at their fourth floor suites.  The biggest issues  is their in ability to  regulate a comfortable or consistent temperature.  It is usually far too cold, (was occasionally as low as the 50's this past winter) and occasionally too hot.   We have alternated between having to (more often) run multiple heaters to keep it warm enough, to (less often) having to open the suite door to get a breeze.  Either one is distracting to deal with and simply un-professional.     We have constantly been reaching out to management, and have a had a variety of responses over the months from ""it's a pre-war building"", to ""we're working on it"" to the most recent which  is that 68 degrees is within their range of acceptability.     The other less (but still) problematic issues is shipping and receiving packages.   There is not standard system for all the carriers, that has been developed, for receiving and sending packages.

I'm giving this three stars for a lot of reasons. I should put it out there that my membership was somewhat non-conventional. I needed a place to do some disciplined studying 24/7 for 3 weeks. I got a 20% off promo, which was $160 and lasted 3 weeks. Beer on tap, free coffee, printing. That is somewhat worth the 8 dollars per day. But it's still overpriced. I realized how overcharged I was when I went to quit and they offered me a month-long membership for $90 dollars to stick around. That's less than half the rate I was being charged EVEN WITH A PROMO. It was great to have a dedicated spot to go work whenever I felt like it, but it started to kill my creativity. The environment seemed sort of superficial and the Bro ratio was a little high for my liking, they literally played the same 20 songs on loop 24/7. If you're a freelancer looking for somewhere to work and build community and you don't mind these things or being overcharged, go for it. That being said, and I mean this in the best of ways to the employees and WeWorkers of Capella Tower: if you want to feel more a part of the rest of society/ the working world, go to a coffee shop or a locally owned co-working space around Minneapolis. The  concept of shared working spaces is by no means new, WeWork just made it really expensive and stuck on some added luxuries to make you feel special.",3

Services. Reception off of the elevator bank, high speed internet, phone service and reception. Copies, fax, notary, mail, delivery services, and you get the idea - full service.

Staff. This is where Metro Offices really shines. The staff is highly efficient, processes requests to an exacting standard, and highly professional in every way.
