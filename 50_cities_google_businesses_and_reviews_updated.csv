Applying for ton of adds and etc. Some of it legit, some not. Today one ""lady"" contacted me and invited for a casting right that day. ""oh, well maybe they are in the rush, whatever"" - I thought. I didn't have the right clothing for casting, so I let her know, she said it's fine. ""kkk"" it got fishy when she said I gotta call her, when I reach the address. why is that??? They don't have an office or secretary?! Alright, I still went, to see what's it about. I got there, she never introduced herself nor gave me a name of the agency. I walked in the nice office, but there was no front desk or anything like that. She brought me to one of the rooms, showed me some kinda website of the agency, that didn't contein of anything but photos of girls. And she got forward to the deal/scam. We will put your photos on our website and connect with clients for $100 one time fee, we don't charge % of work you do with clients it's all yours!! Oh, WOW, such a great deal and only $100!!! Sign me in rn!! Like really??? You would consistently connect me with clients without getting paid, applauds!! Whatta angel! Nope! No legitimate agent will ask you money upfront and denies taking a fee if you booked, otherwise it doesn't worth it to them nor they interested in getting work done. She kept rushing with an answer, if I gonna pay, plus they were shooting rn for future catalog. Duh, probably for more buzz and excitement for ""Green"" model. After I said :""no, thank you!"" she looked dissatisfied and showed me the door, there was another girl waiting. After I left I Googled kin spaces, they are legit, BUT it's coworking space and anybody can rent a space there to work even scamers, unfortunately. Be careful ladies!! Your, Velvet cat on the sun",1

I could not be more pleased with their service. I'm a writer, and the coffee shop atmosphere can be really awkward and booking monthly office space is super costly. So, to have the option (with Croissant) of working in different workspaces around the city (and in other cities) on an hourly basis is so much better and much (MUCH) more cost-efficient than booking entire days. So glad I signed up. I would urge other people thinking about it to just go for it -- really -- at least for the trial period. You won't regret it. 5 stars.",5

The networking and support between members of Alley is far above average in my opinion. 

Honestly speaking, the other spaces has nothing on Alley. To top it off Alley is Now powered by Verizon. So if your in tech, joining the Chelsea location will give you access to next gen 5G. No one else can offer that.",5

The really low quality website is probably a good indicator of that. The only big plus over places in the area is the internet speed, which I clocked at 37M down and 17M up using speedtest.

The space doesn't have the quality that most other spaces in the area have. I found that there was a weird smell that took a while to get used to. The bathrooms were not well maintained and the kitchen area had dirty dishes in the sink. Having been to 5 other coworking spaces within a few weeks in New York, I think it is safe to say that SoTechie is one of the worse ones.

That's not to say it is really bad though, just not great. Considering its proximity to other places like WeWork, Ensemble and The Productive, it is a tough sell.",3

The Manifesto

""Society today does not reflect the highest manifestation of who we can be — and to transform it we must go within and transform ourselves. We see the false consensual belief of separation between individuals as the core problem. Isolation is not our destiny. We do not pretend to have the answers or know how to help anyone, so we come together to start a journey in the pursuit of individual purpose as a function of positive impact on others""",5

Was lied to about MULTIPLE key services that were integral to me joining when given a tour and no-one in customer service responds. If you happen to get anything back from them, it's basically the email equivalent of a shrug.

Great people and a powerful vision, but unfortunately, it seems there may be a bit of posturing that prevents it from truly achieving it's potential, at least for me.

Maybe if I I am in town again, I can give it another chance.

Just to clarify, the staff member who worked with me was very nice. They were not directly rude and suggested a cheaper, more accessible event after refusing me entry (which was a bit weird in the assumption, not going to lie, but it was kind).

Your priorities may vary, but it's likely that you're considering staff, physical plant, and 'vibe'.  IS was the obvious choice for us.  We've been Ignited Spaces customers since 2016 and the only changes have been improvements.

IS is really well thought out, and very attractively designed.  The common spaces are well-equipped with a playful feel.  The technical infrastructure is solid.

The co-worker spaces are calm and quiet.  The offices are spacious, offering both privacy and light.  Depending on where you land, the views run from good to spectacular.

The staff is perhaps the greatest feature of the facility.  They are welcoming, gracious, and accommodating.  I am consistently amazed, notwithstanding the limited time that I personally spend at IS, that people know me on sight, remembering my name and company affiliation.  In my experience, technical issues were solved in minutes.

The IS location is terrific, with a first-tier independent cafe on the ground floor and good quality, affordable restaurants within walking distance.  If you are considering co-working space, you need look no further.",5

I learned about Indie Desk through a friend who recommended it to me. I went to learn more and they gave me a FREE day pass. Next day I managed to do more than I use to achieve when I work in a coffee shop. 

They have good facilities, friendly staff and a cool community of freelancers and entrepreneurs. Something unexpected interacting with the community was that I ended up receiving a free advice from an expert: one of the members who is a video producer with more than 10 years of experience gave me advice to complete a video for marketing a new mobile app.

What I love the most about Indie Desk is its community and the location in Downtown LA. Whether I use my bike or take a bus/metro, I don´t worry about traffic anymore or wasting my time commuting. 

I highly recommend this coworking space to anyone looking for a cool coworking space in a good location with a friendly community. ",5

On the day of, we had two site reps who were both great as well. They were quick to jump to our needs, checked in often, and made sure everything was running smoothly throughout the day.

 The people that work there are super nice and helpful, and there are even events that are held, such as yoga and beer tasting!

 The location is perfect, right in the middle of Little Tokyo. It’s basically across from the cute little Tokyo plaza. Within walking distance there are at least four Boba places  (I’m obsessed with boba)  and so much good food, including the awesome Gen sushi 🍣

A number was provided by Dots Spaces and this number was then placed on our website, business cards and promo cards. 

The company initially kept my card on file despite that I had paid the whole year in advance and kept charging me every month and every month I had to write to them inquiring that why they were charging me, then go through the refund process until one day I had had enough, I shouldn't have had to deal with this sort of thing. By this time it was already halfway through the year so they removed my card but failed to pay for the line that they had already charged me for, thus the line got disconnected. I was then promised by Yoann (Owner) that the phone number will be recovered as I had already printed it on very expensive promo cards and business cards which was impossible for me to repeat! It is evident from the photos that by July they still have no clue that this account is all paid for!

Moving on I felt reassured by Yoann as he called stating that he had got that exact number back and promised that he would take care of that account personally from then on so that this doesn't happen again. I then went on to promote and market the business, however by December I started to think that something was wrong and that why I didn't even have one inquiry despite all the marketing so I called the number and it was disconnected again, I think I was having a heart attack at the time from the shock. I called in again and this time discovered that they had not managed to get the original number that they had given me so they got a different number and didn't even bother to tell me!!!!

I wrote to Yoann many times requesting of him to take responsibility for the damages he has caused me and truly only asked for a small portion of what I had lost, enough so that I could recover from all the losses but I never got any response of any kind, not even a simple apology!

I had very high regards for Yoann but I'm now highly disappointed. This behavior is highly unprofessional and I would not recommend this company to anyone.",1

They go above and beyond the call of duty at all hours of the day.  I probably would have moved out of here a long time ago if it weren't for them.  So, Industrious corporate, take note, this is how you should train anyone who works for you. A+, 5-star, best of the best.  (If you really want a criticism, it is, at the end of the day, a shared workspace...thus you share a kitchen area...and a microwave...meaning you share it with the lady who microwaves fish).  But in all seriousness, it's a great space to work and even feels like a home away from home when you want to smash your head on the keyboard after a long day of work.",5

The staff is amazing and so helpful with anything you need. They have breakfast daily, snacks, and happy hour throughout the week! They also host small events to keep the offices buzzing and to get to know the other companies throughout the building. 

The offices themselves are very large and the furniture provided is quality. The walls are thick so you never have to worry about having hearing a neighbor on the phone or anything. The views are amazing- you can see all the way to Big Bear on a clear day and Santa Monica in the other direction.

The space feels mature which is one thing we like about it most. There are no ""hot desks"" that you might find at a WeWork so the shared spaces are never overrun by random people popping in and out. 

We moved from a WeWork and we could not have made a better decision. Absolutely love this place and the staff here!",5

I was hopping coffee shops before, and when I did the math I'm not only infinitely more productive now, I'm also saving money! 

You can pick an environment to suit your work mood: well lit open lounge seating, bar high top, large shared tables, dedicated desks, enclosed ""phone booths"" that are really mini-lounges, head down quiet areas, what have you. Staff is extremely responsive, friendly, and helpful (shout out Catherine and Lani!). There's parking underneath, a bus stop on the corner, and restaurants galore in the area. Coffee is good and plentiful (cold brew on tap is the devil, stick to the fresh ground unless you're a caffeine fiend).

Make sure you actually take the tour, because it took me a month to realize there was additional open seating and window facing phone booths down a hallway I had assumed was all private offices.

Level staff creates events (lunch & learns, happy hours, etc.) which make it easy to meet other people in the location. We’ve made connections that lead to new business, new partners, and new friends. You also can utilize the other Level Office locations if you have a meeting in River North or West Loop, or even in many other cities nationwide. The Level Office staff seems to know everyone by name which makes the place seem cozy even though it’s pretty big.

I was invited to co-work here with a friend a few weeks ago, and was really impressed with the lighting, furniture, and balance between startups and individuals working here. What's unique about this space is that the teams that have offices here often work out in the open area. By the second day, I had already met and talked to at least three different startup groups, which is so rare and wonderful, considering I've been comparing co-working spaces for quite awhile. 

The Herman Miller desking offers generous surface area for spreading out, many convenient outlets, and there are skylights sprinkled throughout the space for a natural daylit loft ambiance. It is pretty quiet now, but I think Space will hit a critical mass soon, especially with groups like the Experience Institute making regular appearances. Get in now while you can!",5

Hosting the shower in my small apartment was not an option and a restaurant just didn't fit into our budget. After an extensive Google search I came across FRO. While it's original intention is to support the needs of workers and entrepreneurs I could see how the owners expanded their scope of services to include advertising the space as a great place to host some what larger gathers. 

After going to FRO for a walk through I knew it was perfect! My 50 guest would be able to enjoy themselves in the spacious, sunny, clean space and there was even the extra bonus of a small outdoor balcony.  

The day of my baby shower everything went PERFECT. I was able to minimally decorate, the FRO staff helped with table and chair set and break down, my guests were all able to easily park on the street and everyone absolutely loved the space. So many people asked me how I found it. 

I would recommend FRO if you are hosting a small gathering, meeting, book club etc. In addition to it being a beautiful space I also have to mention how reasonably priced it was to host my event there. Obviously getting ready for baby can be very expensive.    FRO gave me the opportunity host family and friends in a classy way without breaking the bank. 

Great concept! I'd definitely recommend checking it out!  ",5

However the building the Make offices are in is a hot mess. The elevators are frequently broken making it extremely time consuming to get to the make offices (sometimes people have to wait 10+ minutes for an elevator). The building also houses a school which means that there are frequently young kids blocking the entrance. I've witnessed multiple people raising the issue to the building staff however they really aren't willing to work with the school to resolve the issue.

Finally some tenants don't respect the personal space and needs of other tenants. You can frequently find tenants taking sales or personal calls in front of private offices that they don't lease even though there are private call rooms provided. This lack of respect for others needs can make working in the space a bit more stressful than necessary depending on who you get placed next to.",3

I also believe they are really well priced. They throw member events frequently and the overall vibe is of businesses that are less in the startup phase and more into the second step of their growth. It’s also a fantastic spot to collaborate with other organizations and share your expertise. There are two floors and they are pretty different. This is the only space we have been in where the kitchen is massive and the amenities are fantastic! Every other place we have been to – the fridges were so tiny that everyone was battling for space but not here! The place is cleaned daily and we never have to worry about this. If we want to clean our own space – they have everything we need. The WIFI is really strong as well. The location is also fantastic for getting really inexpensive food, 15 min walk from the lake and minutes away from every CTA line. None of us have to walk very far to get to the office from the train. The area is also fantastic for events that are blocks away, such as the farmers market in the summer, parades, and much more!

And we’re still paying.. we have never stopped paying.. they moved us to another office on the 5th floor.. which is not what we signed up for on our contract. And so now there’s another company using our space, our curtains, our cords, boards... stuff that we own etc.. we have gone through 3 different people who just send us to the other.. and back and forth. No one answers.. no one calls back.. it’s a mess. This is literally my first review ever.. and it’s with the only intention to let everyone who’s looking for a space here to look somewhere else. Somewhere that will guarantee something like this will never happen. Read your contracts, ask questions, and have a lawyer handy. If you do those 3, don’t be surprised if Novel still screws you over to secure their interests.",1

Our corporate office told us that we needed to move into a more traditional office setting.  After looking at offices all over downtown, we could not find anything that didn't require an extensive build out or would have involved a shared office space situation.  When we returned from office hunting, our COO grabbed a flyer from the entrance of the building and learned that Novel Co-Working had the perfect space at a reasonable price.  So instead of moving across downtown, we relocated to a different floor.  The space is perfect for our team.  We still have access to the cool co-working space/lounge that Novel Co-Working has, which includes a really fancy beverage machine (makes coffee like a barista) and beer on tap.  I have not had the opportunity to partake of the beer on tap, but it's nice to know that I can invite family and friends to meet me after work, grab a beer and then head out on the town.",5

Initially I started off as a Revolving member but after my membership requirements changed and I needed to leave my items there regularly, I spoke with a Team Member that was happy to help. I was informed that if I upgraded my membership and paid for a desk then I could leave my items around. I was informed about the security cameras that were placed around and one was in the direction of my desk.

Recently my MacBook pro went missing and I verified that it last synced at the office while I was away. After contacting a STATION Team member I found out that their cameras were no longer active since they took them down during remodeling. Turns out the renovations had been complete for several months before the first incident. Unfortunately, the STATION Team chose not to take proactive action and reconnect the cameras and over the upcoming week, other members items came up missing.

The STATION Team would regularly not respond request about info relating to the issues and often required people to find them in person. Many members have had the same issues with the STATION Team relating to the theft incidents.

On top of that, a new accelerator moved in out of nowhere, and several STATION Members had their ""permanent"" desk re-assigned without fair warning. 

It has been a fair amount of time that the STATION Team was supposed to contact building security and give a response about the footage related to the incident but have failed. 

Many current members have become disappointed as well as previous Team Members.

Please factor this into consideration if you plan on looking at a membership.",2

Two things they can't control have been the only minor inconveniences so far- the mobile app for booking conference room space is clunky and not so easy to use; and there is a lot of construction going on around the building that makes getting into the building somewhat difficult.

I left that meeting and went straight to Servcorp.  When I walked in I was curt and on the edge of being rude as I demanded the straight scoop on the offerings at this location.  I was directed to Kaci, and she was fantastic. She put up with my blunt rudeness in an incredibly professional and friendly manner. She never stopped smiling. She gave me an accurate and quick straight to the point answer for every one of my needling questions. I admit that I can be tough on sales people, but she handled my disagreeable manner perfectly. I was overcome by her positive, friendly, and intelligent answers. She knows her business, and she knows how to handle people.

After what must have for her been a grueling 2 hours of my intense scrutiny, she completely convinced me of the value in the Servcorp offerings, and I signed up for a contract.

I also think this is a great space for professional events. They are building an outdoor deck too, which I’m sure will be a hit as well. They have a huge private parking lot which is a plus. 

Most importantly, the staff there are very nice and truly provide excellent customer service. Their  accommodations are top notch and you can tell the owners aims to please and make sure that everyone is taken care of and happy. A real family type vibe. One tour and you’ll be hooked.

Some months ago, I was referred to TXRX by key individuals on the Station Houston team and several client members of that organization. While I initially experienced difficulty in scheduling a visit and conversation, the wait and effect were well worth my while. 

On the day I was able to visit, even though the facility was receiving a large group of visitors from an area high school, I was personally met at the door by Mr. Ronnie Devries, TXRX Operations Manager, who proceeded to give me a detailed and extended tour of all the many and varied spaces and core areas, seeded across multiple buildings. Ronnie is affable, knowledgeable and welcoming, and his patter as we toured made this a most enjoyable experience. The facilities spaces, equipment an activities definitely speak to the dedicated ""maker community"" - both those who are on TXRX staff and the many, varied client members of the extensive organization. 

With obvious pride and excitement Mr. Devries shared that this bustling campus was experiencing such phenomenal growth the organization is now in the process of identifying a much larger capacity physical complex, in order to address the growth, expansion of services and diversity of programming. So inspired was I by the community, facilities and team of workers and volunteers of this not-for-profit organization, I was moved to begin introducing others to TXRX, and look forward to availing myself of their services, in future. 

A huge ""thank you,"" to the TXRX family for being so welcoming and receptive to exploring the possibilities for collaboration, and to those who first commended this organization to me. Insofar as I am concerned (having only recently relocated to the Houston area), TXRX is exactly the kind of critical infrastructure needed in Houston...really, in any city of this size, in facilitating and inspiring its start-up and maker communities.

This has been the most horrible and unimaginable experience I have ever had. I have lost business clients  from unwelcoming Staff, lost packages and important mail and items, clients unattended in the lobby without notifying me of their arrival, falsifying free parking to only charge you after you sign your contract, incorrect charges, and unauthorized charges from my bank account. Upon giving my notice I was promised a new office of a renovated area to only notify months later that all what was promised would be happening another year from now. DO NOT LEASE WITH THIS COMPANY. There was a car break-in that non of us tenants were notified about, which put all of our safety at risk especially women, along with months of not having working water, and a quarter exchange of staff that’s unsure about office protocol and procedures. Unacceptable, on every level. Save yourself a headache, I can barely perform professionally with all the stress. The worst is my clients have to experience this with me.

Their ""FlyBy"" day passes are great for me as I only need the space once every month. When I need to take a quick call, their ""phone booths"" have a great audio quality by dampening any external sound. They have clean desks. The chairs are suitable for a days work.

With a great little coffee and kitchen area, if you need a break you can just step back there and relax a bit. If you need to get out, the location is in close proximity to many good restaurants.

First of all, the energy is very high and infectious. You are surrounded by like-minded people, all of whom are working hard. I seem to get more done here than any of my other offices. 

The staff are extraordinarily nice and always looking to help you. They really go out of their way to make you get everything you need. 

The premises is pretty amazing. I purposely hold meetings here just to show off the glass, the steel and the space. My clients love it. 

Finally, the pricing is very reasonable. The lowest membership $250 a month is steal considering the access, the printing and conference room availability. 

It's for all these reasons that Galvanize has become the gold standard for social work hubs and spaces in Phoenix.",5

It’s set up for my success without the distractions at the other places. 

The staff, from President and CEO Matt Fehling to Director of Entrepreneur Programs Kimberly Roland, welcomed me along with their concierge team, gave me a tour, listened to what I’m up to, supported it and topped it off with delicious bottomless coffee from local nonprofit Cultivate.

I have a place to maximize everything admin for my 24 year matchmaking company SPIES. I set up dates and meet clients in private. If I met them here you’d all want to office here for sure!! 😄♥️

Today I worked on my laptop and used their excellent treadmill desk and knocked out 8200 steps. 

If you’re an Accredited BBB Business, there are offices in the Community Building next door you can reserve free! ignite sparked has two affordable offices open to everyone using the space. 

I love the bright yellow (DryBar yellow) touches and the motivational quotes everywhere. 

The final reason I’m working at the Phoenix BBB coworking space is to be surrounded by a powerful organization that leads with ethics! And fosters entrepreneurship. 

As a matchmaker, everything I do has to be with an ethical eye. I was in the Navy and am from the Midwest. SPIES was a Finalist in the Torch Awards for Ethics with the BBB. When I needed their wise consult this week, they were there for me and my company.

Kimberly Roland explained they plan to keep costs down because as a nonprofit, they are here to serve businesses. And consumers.

Thank you for a great first week! 
And great Wi-Fi.",5

The review is based upon what was promised by the sales person and industrious marketing material.

Our team has been working here since day one.

Pros; beautiful decor, large common areas, good location.

Con; lack of food, snacks, drinks throughout the day and evening. Lack of attentiveness and response from the community manager (Doug) with existing members/tenants. Lack of signage in the mall, difficult for guest to enter. Retention, several members are already leaving.

I can understand why up-and-coming entrepreneurs would be attracted to such a space: it's fresh-looking professional space for those who can't quite afford their own brick-and-mortar space to conduct business but don't want to meet clients at their home offices or at, say, a coffeehouse. 

The 3rd floor rooms are soundproof but all share an clean open reception area, a conference room, and a kitchenette. Everyone can feel like they're doing corner-office work and can bring their clients and interviewees to a place that represents them and their companies well.

I came here on a whim for a art exhibition and was pleasantly surprised by the The Yard's offerings. 

The Yard is a co-working space offering a place for anyone to rent space to not only work but network as well. The building is right near Chinatown/Jefferson area - so lots of foot traffic and slim parking! 

The night I visited was when they were having an art gallery of works by different artists (both local and national) being showcased throughout the space on all the floors. It's a nice touch to exhibit the art in a more real environment - gave the pieces a home.

Outside of the workspace provided, The Yard has amenities such as coffee, drinks, WiFi to list a few. The space really enhances collaboration, and brings creativity to the forefront.

For anyone that needs an area to get work done, network, get their creative juices flowing, etc. this place has all the offerings!",4

Jillian, the events coordinator said she hoped this space could become s place where people come to collaborate and to make friends and I think that started happening.

There were many guitarists together with a smattering of other musicians, including a couple of keyboardists, a rapper and a flugelhorn player. Most of the work was original, and there were a few improvisational collaborations, including a jam after the open mic was over. 

People responded warmly to most of the musician's efforts. That kind of kindness is really helpful in developing the confidence and camradery that can keep people coming back just to see a wide variety of material, presented at a variety of levels of expertise. 

The fact that that camradery seemed to be developing bodes well for the future of this event. I think all the musician's really appreciated Lia's efforts. I hope people continue to check out this event and expect it to be a fun evening in the future.",5

Although succes or failure is ultimately based on the decisions you make as well as the work and sacrifices you put in to your endeavor hard work and good decision making may not be enough to gaurentee success.

Temple SBDC does not can not and will not gaurentee your success but with thier help and assistance guidence and councel and by surrounding yourself with other entrepreneurs who are as young and aspiring as yourself and has experianced some of the pitfalls you may can and will experience the probabilities of success increases and you greatly reduce the probabilities of failure.

This organization allows one to pursue anything from a DIY project, yet don't have the equipment and space to complete, to attending a class to learn a new skill such as welding, laser cutting or how to use & create w/a 3D printer. And so much more! 

I find this place to be the ideal location for me to follow through with my dreams of producing my art and learning add'l skills in order to realistically achieving my goals, sooner than later, in becoming a full time artist!  

Anyone should feel honored to meet the kind and motivated members of this organization who have inspired me to realize the true artist that I am and always have been yet - had no idea how I would ever pull it off without their guidance in order to begin attaining my dreams.

 Almost made me wana close my business being harassed by them every day and every week.  If you are a start up company this is not the place for you!!!! You will get nickle and dime to death!!! Copies, packages, phone patching, forwarding calls, etc., Signed a lease for $700 and my bill was usually $1,000-$1,100 Lost tons of potential business with their phone systems too, but if you have someone in that office and calls not forwarded to your cell you will be okay.
   If you have a established business and looking for a 
Professional place to move with a receptionist to answer your phones how you need them to be answered like a accounting company, lawer or high profile business then this is the place for you! Great atmosphere, stunning view of the city from their 15th floor office and great prices for renting a conferance room for professional business meetings. 
 Their contacts autorenew unless you give them written notice 2 months in advance, but certainly careful because they will still autorenew your contract! Gave them my notice for a 6 month contract so I can move out and they would not give it to me?! They said I never notified them and was in another 1 year contract. Luckily I save all my emails and they acknowledged it with a approved movers list so I was able to get my 6 month lease instead of a year lease. Was a long waste of time going back and forth. They also would forget to apply payments to my account sometimes but luckily I kept all my reciepts. Printer is always breaking too, very frustrating when you have a client and have to have him sign papers but cant print them out (happened multiple times). But If you have extra money to pay the fee to have a printer in your office you'll be fine. And never ask for a discount on your bill, I asked for a $50 discount for copies I didnt make they added $250 onto my final bill and gave me a $50 discount I asked for lol. Never had a complete month where I recieved all my amenities I paid for and got tired of having to email them about it and finally gave up.
Happy I'm finally out of there!! 😁

The same day I notified Charles a few hours later I get this voicemail from the owner Jerry Hagee so I called him back that's when he said that my type of business doesn't fall under his vision for the office box so I wont be able to rent from him, yet no where on their website does is say what type of business he envisioned for the office box, this is what the website says:""OFFICE BOX® is a good fit for freelancers, entrepreneurs, home based and mobile workers. The goal is to build a unique diverse community of professionals in our shared office space where collaboration, networking and creativity flows"". 

In the voicemail he left he says ""for something like that(my type of business) I'll have to sign a 3 year lease otherwise I won't be able to lease it"" like what ??? you advertised it as a no commitment month to month deal yet you want me to sign a 3yr contract! So not cool, just because you can't get the rooms rented out doesn't mean you start putting people on contracts.

I wasn't going to leave a review I was planning on just to let it go but at the end of the day what stops them from doing it the next person that gets excited about the space only to get crushed down",1

So this guy brought me to the very back room and plopped us in front of a garbage can, and said, ""Here, let's talk here at the trash can.""  Literally.

He then downplayed his venue and space to ME -- and I'm sure he has his reasons... which I'd rather not know. 

I actually felt he was going out of his way to make me feel uncomfortable. He even began pitching me about co-working spaces downtown, at which point, he finally smiled and was actually trying to persuade me.

Then you get into the contract, and Regus is completely unfair. Even malicious. They charge without permission, overcharge, slam you with fees for printing, meetings, and even coffee, and even charge after your contract ends. Though the staff at this particular location is very nice, the office product they sling is surrounded with hidden contingencies - addenda and clauses favorable to only them.

The latest example of this is them charging me $349/mo. for three months AFTER my contract ends for what they 'Business Continuity Service'. Calling to inquire, they told me this fee is for them to hold onto my mail (??!!!? Not deliver it to me, just hold on to it)

Chance after chance over nearly two years, Regus has proven their true colors. If you want to double-pay for office space, go here. If you want something fair, reasonable, and more-professional in a nicer building, check out Symphony Towers - the 33rd floor.

The challenge is finding anyone with any type of customer service or communication skills. Their billing is extremely dreadful. They make lots of mistakes, and when they do, they don't just credit you back. Instead, they make you pay the entire invoice (including the mistake) and then will credit you back the following month. It doesn't sound like it's an issue until you find  yourself tracking down bunches of accounting and billing mistakes. 

No one at the center or regional positions can resolve any challenges or issues that come up. They refer you to the ""help desk"" (it's anything but helpful). No one can resolve your issue and when you ask to escalate to a  manager, they tell you it'll be 24-48 hours. Then weeks go by and no manager ever calls you back.

Essentially, when I terminated my lease, the manager at the center (at the time) suggested that i sign up for a 3-month mail forward service. I thought it might be a good idea for 1 month, but she said you have to sign up for 3. So i did. 

Then when i got my 3rd bill, I sent a note to cancel, because i didn't want to renew for another term. It went unanaswered and I forgot about it. Then i got another bill for the following month, so i called to cancel. Weeks went by and i got a call that said i had to cancel on line. So i logged in to cancel and the only button to click was ""next"" and the system inadvertently extended me for another 3 months..

SOOOOO... I called to have them reverse it - and they WONT. OMG are you kidding me? What kind of ridiculous organization is this? Then i try to escalate and can't get any help. Just a phone call from the front desk telling me that i have to pay.

There are soooo many other options for executive office space. My strong recommendation is to not use Regus. They are beyond awful.",1

The building and office are nice for use a virtual office, everything we need for a meeting can be found in the office, the boardroom is quite spacious and designed in a professional appeal. The parking lot is easy to get in and out of, with front row parking for short visits when picking up mail or documents and a large amount of parking for my clients to use that they do not have to pay for.

And here is why: I think it would be ideal for Regus to fully disclose its brand: Regus- The Hidden Fees Company. (I am not being very creative  :D) So let me give you a good glimpse of what you are about to sign up for: hidden fees. I have been here for a a few months now and every single month the rent (and it is not really a rent because they are not a real estate company. They are a membership company and they compare themselves to a gym membership) is different and you get charged for things you wouldn't really expect. For example, I was granted permission to move in 4 days earlier than my lease term which was nice but then their IT had charge me 4 x $12/day for internet usage because I had setup my computer and plugged it in their wall internet. I found out that the usage of their kitchen was not initially included in the lease amount and I was being charged an additional $10/day for kitchen use. You can opt out of it and not go to kitchen. LOL They also tell you that you have a phone line that you can use but then there are a variation of minute by minute charges depending, I think, on which US zip code you call. So for example one domestic call had cost me $7.56 Basically the same thing you get for free on your cellphone, they charge you for it. And then you get charged a tax amount (not really clear to me what the percentages are) on top of every variation of the charge. So by my calculations, if you are a busy business owner, making a bunch of calls every day, you can really pay up to twice as much as you initially thought you had the office for. The building has conference rooms but you have to pay a minimum of $65/hr for a conference room which is basically a small room with a few chairs a table. They are more impressive meeting rooms for $110/hr. The conference rooms are not available over the weekends. I am pretty sure there are a whole bunch of other hidden charges that I have not yet come across but I wouldn't be surprised if I see a charge for over usage of internet above 5GB :D or some other ridiculous thing. Do yourself a favor and find another company. I am being very honest with you and sharing my objective experience here. The one star is a bear minimum of the ranking and that goes to their nice and super friendly staff.",1

Update: See response below from the owner or office manager with even more threats and lies just as before. Thank you for giving me even more proof of the defamatory things you have said and done against me. I was never evicted and no one tried to save my lease. 

I was clearly being harassed and bullied by  manager Mike Hollemans and for safety reasons, I moved out of the office due to conditions that were unfavorable to me and any of my clients. I have proof of that as well. 

Furthermore, please do the math as stated I signed my agreement on February 13, 2019 and did not move in until the 19th. Today’s date is May 4, 2019.

The primary negative is that there are well-known ""fakers"" that have infiltrated the mentor and speaker networks. People that claim to have experience, successes, and credentials. The same people that you see at other startup events, and you know they are lying. People claiming large exits, important government positions, CEOs of successful companies, and so on. 

Spend more time making sure these people are who and what they claim before endorsing and entrusting them.

Don't tell any of my out-of-town coworkers but I happen to think WeWork Riverpark Tower is our best WeWork location (sorry not sorry). We moved into our suite on February 1 and while there was still some some construction punch list items outstanding and it wasn't without bumps in the road, all items were handled with professionalism and speed by Laura and her team. The resolution of issues vs. the absence of issues is what I rate service received on. By that standard, the service received here is top notch.

 The WeWork Riverpark Tower team (at every level) work so hard to make the experience of working here seamless and do it all with a smile. They love to hear feedback on how things can be improved and they implement the very best ideas. The fellow members and the Community Team come up with great, creative events which makes it a pleasure to come to work on a daily basis.

I never write reviews but I need to warn others, as the owners are crooks. If I could I would give ZERO stars

Here are a few of the highlights of this place: 

1. Kiss your deposit goodbye...
2. Re-read the contract, because what they say and what is written is completely different, the lease is month to month, but they will randomly change it to yearly if you are not careful.
3. The wall are so thin, I could hear the guy next door sipping his coffee.
4. The office rent is $500- 750 per month, but I over heard neighbor complaining that the contact sent was $1200 per month. they refused to change and where FORCING him to pay and stay 1 year!!! ( LIKE I SAID THE OFFICE WALLS ARE SO THIN)
4. They are always in constant breach of contract -The Internet in the building was consistently slow and unreliable 
5. Only 1 building has a receptionist. My building has no-one...so random people walk around trying to open the office doors. 
6. The package/ mail room is not secure so anyone can take your packages. And even in the main lobby, there is just rarely someone there. Just a screen that dials some random number that no one picks up. 
7. They will access your private office without notice and take things. They took the blinds from my office

For such a small person, she has amazing strength and knows how to use her arms and hands for the perfect amount of pressure. I highly recommend you see her.

Yesterday, I switched up and got a massage from Will. IT WAS INCREDIBLE! As soon as he started, I could immediately tell that I would enjoy it. I have a hard time finding a massage therapist who knows how much pressure to use and let me tell you, Will had the perfect amount of pressure consistently through out my massage. A quarter of the way through I could feel my entire body was relaxed and the tense muscles in my shoulders had finally been relieved of their strenuous duty. When the massage was finished, I was in awe over how relaxed I really was. I stayed on the bed for an additional 5 minutes just to soak in this feeling of serenity that was so new and foreign to me.

They are all wonderful ladies, they are very friendly and always say ""Good morning"" when I come in, and ""Have a good evening!"" when I leave. They also make small talk during the day and don't treat me like a client, more like a friend. 
The kitchen is always well kept and clean. They do a great job at keeping up with the dishes in the sink and the dishwasher. They are very accommodating and will go out of their way to help us.

The facilities and spaces are stunning with high quality desks and seating, private meeting rooms that are  easy to self book and manage your own schedule and space needs.

They keep the coffee hot, the wifi on point and often surprise and delight members with snacks and events, speakers, parties on a regular basis. They work hard each and every day to create an authentic community of like minded business leaders killing it day in and day out to drive business performance. At Link, you aren't in it alone.

The success stories coming out of the thought leaders at Link are limitless, its fun being in the mix with companies and entrepreneurs at every stage of their growth and I have to believe that the environment the Link provides plays a key part in the success of all of our businesses.

I’ve hosted small group breakout sessions, board game nights (great and small), happy hours, brunch, and even a three day, multiple venue, conference with Atmosphere serving as my largest venue. The design of both the actual physical space and the furniture allow for SO many configurations, I can’t believe the number of ways I’ve played tetris to serve radically different needs and different layouts. And, I’ve flipped the room from a conference venue to a happy hour in less than an hour…magic! Perhaps the greatest magic of all is that it doesn’t feel like “just a space,” it does as the name suggests, it’s creates an “atmosphere” that permeates all of the events I’ve ever created there.

It is currently a better version of itself than it was a couple of years ago. (It was really great when first opened too.) I think the improvement over two years ago is because there is competition in the neighborhood and the owners are trying harder. And some of the a**holes who formerly coworked here are gone.

Being here at Capital Factory has given me more value than I could ever imagine. 

When I first came here in 2017, I'll be honest...my startup was doing well, but it was not making a lot of money. So it wasn't such an easy decision to invest in a space like this. But it has made such a big difference in my day to day life. I FEEL like coming to work. I feel inspired. I know I can meet good people to make my business run successfully. 

Coming here, I knew very little about the tech scene, but I knew that I could meet tech-minded people who can grow my business. Since then, I've partnered with a programmer and a data scientist who have developed tools for my clients to improve their lives. We are currently working on artificial intelligence software that helps my clients write better resumes to land them their dream job.

In the last two years, my company's revenue has 5x'd. And no, I'm not giving ALL the credit to Capital Factory...it takes a $##! ton of hard work and consistency to get there, but sometimes I wonder how far I really would have gone if I had still been working from home. There is something about the energy of this place that makes me want to keep going. 

I need to give a massive shout out to the hard working staff that works here. They are all unbelievable. Not going to exclude anyone because there are too many people that make this place run successfully, but the entire staff is absolutely fantastic. Praise the operations and FRONT DESK team on all floors (1, 5, 8, and 16) because I feel absolutely welcome every moment I step in this place. No matter what they are getting, they deserve a raise. I love each and every one of them.",5

Don’t give your money to a company that will throw you under the bus. There are plenty of co-working spaces in Austin that care about small startups.

""It should have been here"" - is the response I got. It's less than 4 hours I was there. She does not even care to apologize but expect me to come back with alternate ticket from garage. Acts as if it's no body business. That's the only task they had to do and they screw it. Unprofessional. Unsensible. I had to pay 30 bucks for her mistake.

2196,ChIJdc2aFW3MRIYRde_fe4T8QnU,WeWork,"11801 Domain Blvd 3rd Floor, Austin, TX 78758, USA",4.0,"I left WeWork recently because of an issue of racial profiling that would have put myself and my staff and potential clients at risk that they shouldn't be subject to.

Sadly, no matter the facts, they just aren't interested in making changes that they say they're open to. They refer to their diversity programs but how are those programs really impactful if you can harass people like me and subject them to a clear double standard and furthermore the staff and management not take responsibility?

In the end, since God has blessed me to be an employer, I could have done two things...go take legal action and spend resources and time for something that was a dicey situation or make a bigger power move, move my company and future business to someone else. I chose the latter.

Sometimes, it's best to just take my business elsewhere and in this instance, I got a better situation where I'm paying more money, but that is money WeWork will never get going forward because of how they decided to mistreat me. That perhaps is the best way to send a message.

I also canceled my membership with Wework Gas Company Tower because of how their New York Corporate executive management handled me. See, they lost two accounts and their rival got more money from me and will continue to get more money long term because of how they decided to speak to me.

Be careful about how you treat customers. Not only did I leave but I wound up giving another company even more money in the short term and long term. Customer service does matter and I can hurt them in their pocketbook without filing a lawsuit.

Just because I'm a black business owner doesn't mean that I don't have the ability to make money or just accept substandard service.",1

There was a miscommunication about my team size, but they worked to accommodate us as best they could.  The extra tables were a touch too high given the folding chairs however, and had sharp corners which conspired with the height difference to make extended working uncomfortable.

Warm is the first word that comes to mind. Every woman there was so warm and welcoming--both the team and paying members.

I was worried that if there was no potential of me coming on as a member, they might prefer I not come in. Wrong. No questions asked, they responded quickly and said ""yes, girl! come on in for a free trial day!"" When I arrived, Gracie greeted me and gave me a tour of the space. Nothing was off limits and I could sit wherever I pleased, which was so nice since some workspaces only offer specific desks, have a million quiet zones, etc. I felt so at home instantly. Later, I desperately needed a phone charger and Gracie (shoutout #2, hey girl!!) gave me hers. Everything was spotlessly clean and no detail was left unnoticed. I would HIGHLY recommend this for any woman in Austin--SO wish I lived here.

We had noble pig do the catering (also wonderful) and did flowers ourselves. It's so easy to make this place into whatever you want. All of the people we worked with were exceptionally friendly and laid back. I think the vendors appreciated the laid back, yet very professional, approach of the venue also. Everything was in place by the time we showed up to set up, and the whole night went very smoothly. Can't say enough how much we enjoyed holding our big party there.

When my husband and I moved here, we had gotten jobs that had long hours and we are unable to give our corgi the amount of time she needed to be fully exercised.  We started bringing her to another daycare in the area and at first she loved it, but after awhile of going, she would come home and still have an exuberant amount of energy. It became frustrating because we felt she wasn't getting the exercise that she needed and   her energy level would not change, regardless of her going to Daycare.  Come to find out, Penny spent almost half of her day kenneled!  

The reason why Work and Woof is amazing is because she's not kenneled at all. She gets to play all day, take her naps when she wants to, if she even wants to. There are places where dogs can lay down and take a breather.  The best part of the day is watching the videos they post and you can see all of them just napping together! :)

Jill and her staff have become Penny's family and she is so excited to see them every time we pull up to the building, so much so that she pretty much let's herself into the place.  If you have not checked this spot out, you should do so immediately! I'm so happy we found Work and Woof when we did!",5

I can't speak to all the sides of the buildings, but the side that faces Baptist, gets extremely warm. Around 4 PM it gets up to 81 degrees. Around 6 PM it is around 83-84 degrees. Part of the reason is because they turn off the air conditioning and heating between 5 PM and 9 AM. They keep them turned off during the weekend and which ever holidays they feel like. HOWEVER, you can pay extra to have them turned on.

We asked if there are any issues, or problems because we are a company that will be operating 24/7. We were told no, but I'm sorry this is Florida - how is no AC not a problem nor issue?

BE VERY CAREFUL. The big issue with Regus always is how bad they treat you when you leave. It's not the local staff it's the corporate headquarters. They gouge you with fees, and crazy charges that make everyone that I have ever met, who's left a Regus, angry and upset. Why they do this is beyond me. Seems like a terrible thing to do to a good customer. But they do it all the time.

 Make sure you read your contract carefully. Do not forget that your contract Auto renews if you do not give them written notice. What happens to many people is their contract gets extended for another 12 months before they even know about it. Then when the conversation comes up they look in their contract and see the clause they never paid attention to previously. They do it on purpose and they do not care that it upsets their customers. 

Their corporate headquarters are run by terrible people. I even had a branch manager that I knew quit because of the unethical things they were demanding that she do regarding pricing and customer charges. They should be ashamed of themselves
 
She was an amazing manager and all the customers loved her but they treated her like garbage. It was awful to see.

Maybe Ensemble and Common Space just cater to different crowds but Common Space is quickly expanding across DFW so they must be doing something right.

Favorable treatment is definitely observed between employees and “regular “ customers. This same level of care for customers is very much so selective.
There has also been a considerable decrease and inconsistency in the quality of drinks.",1

The community is super nice and incredibly entrepreneurial. I've connected with many ""co-workers"" here at the comfortable lunch table and accommodating kitchen. Free coffee and granola bars every morning is a huge plus. The monthly taco parties don't hurt either!

We needed something away from home and private, but equipped to help our productivity. April, the community manager, suggested Industrious for the day, and the experience exceeded our expectations.

April's directions for parking were spot on, we had access to amazing culinary choices for our lunch break, and the space was exactly what we needed. She provided snacks, beverages, all necessary hardware to connect to remotely and to present. The restrooms were impeccably clean, the security guards at the entrance very polite, & other long and short term companies and individuals had their own spaces and never infringed on ours. It was rejuvenating to have a new place to help generate new ideas, keep us focused, and enjoy a special part of the city together. 

Industrious in Columbus is highly recommended for a half day, full day, or multi-day space need.",5

April is so thoughtful, kind and is always looking to bring all of the members together in new, fun settings. They have the usual free coffee, breakfast items, snacks, etc. but what I think makes Industrious different is that every Wednesday morning they will cater a local breakfast item. We also do fun afternoon snacks on Tuesdays and Thursday (most time of the time they are themed - Taco Tuesdays, hummus bar, etc.). I would highly recommend in joining!",5

I've worked at various offices across the US and the UK and this was the best office, with the best management and the best co-workers. At the time the job I had did not require me to be physically present at my desk, but I would drive 40miles (one way) just to be amongst some of the most inspiring and smart people (aka other Perch peeps) I've ever encountered! Tracy and Bob make everyone feel so welcome... They are amazing! During my 2 years there I have not met one other member that I didn't like... Everyone is super intelligent, friendly, and most importantly, helpful.. I've gotten advice on so many things that helped me in both professional and personal life. For a person not from Columbus, everyone was super helpful in connecting me with people so I could grow my network, and I know I wouldn't get the same help at other co-working spaces. We had monthly happy hours at local restaurants and bars, the fridge is always stocked with beer and the coffee is amazing (and local!). I highly, highly recommend The Perch.

This move represents a cost savings for the nonprofit organization with which I am involved and provides a location at which to store many of our items.

Our monthly public meetings [that usually include a speaker or other program] are held on Saturdays at 12:00 noon. The building is locked on Saturdays, which means that a member of our group must staff the front door to let people into the building and then use a computer chip to allow people onto the elevator so that they will be able to travel to the second floor so that they will be able to enter the Club Level CoWorking suite of rooms and then enter the meeting room.

The bathroom [which is around the corner on the second-floor hallway] requires a three-digit code to enter [which I can understand from a ""security"" standpoint] but I had been horrified at the end of our meeting to learn that we had been locked into our meeting room [within the Club Level CoWorking suite of rooms] with no means of escape [even to the Club Level CoWorking entrance lobby] unless someone with a computer chip unlocks that door.",3

While definitely a great location for able-bodied people [and there is an elevator between the first floor and the second floor], the Columbus Advisory Committee on Disability Issues [CACDI] quickly learned that the Columbus Idea Foundry is nearly impossible to travel to via public transportation if you are a wheelchair user because Lucas St., a poorly-maintained brick street with intermittent sidewalks on the east side of the building, is nearly impossible to navigate for people who use wheelchairs.",5

Looking to moderate my costs, I considered the “virtual office” concept and contacted Office Evolution, among other such businesses. I ended up choosing Office Evolution because they offered more cost effective plans and was located close to my home. It turned out to be the best decision I could have made. Right from the initial meeting, Natalie and Lisa made me feel right at home and basically rolled out the red carpet. They listened to my needs and fit me with a package that allowed me to become profitable almost instantly. They truly cared about me and my business like they were partners. I was blown away. Since that meeting their services have been beyond my expectations and they continue to care as much as the first day. I’d also like to specially thank Natalie that acts more like my employee than OE’s. She always goes above and beyond to make it appear as if this is my exclusive office and if I ever have a question or concern (not often), she personally sees to it that it is answered and that I am satisfied. She is like family. Basically, I cannot say enough about Office Evolution. If you are looking to open an office but want to avoid all the unneeded costs, this is the place and these are the people to align yourself with.

2681,ChIJB6dnWlz0OIgRIrMaVlerL2w,PS Executive Centers - Office Space Columbus,"1900 Polaris Pkwy #450, Columbus, OH 43240, USA",4.8,"I used to have a traditional law office with an administrative assistant working in my office.  I felt like I had to work in my office for three reasons:  (1) that's where I received calls, (2) that's where our locally networked office management software was located, and (3) that's where my assistant was working.  

Technology changed my office operation.  With VOIP, I can receive calls at my office number and have them patched to my cell phone wherever I am.  With cloud-based office management software and data storage, my paralegal and I can work from anywhere we have an internet connection.  

Technology changed my office operation, but I still need a place to meet clients, I still need a place to work sometimes, and I need someone to handle inbound phone calls and other administrative tasks.  That place is PS Executive Centers, and that someone is the PS administrative associates. The conference rooms are perfect for meeting clients, the common areas project a professional image appropriate for a law firm, and the day offices are great places to get work done.  The administrative associates effectively handle my incoming calls according to protocol tailored to my needs, and they also assist me with administrative tasks and projects.  

By using PS Executive Centers, I have saved an estimated $15,000 in overhead per year.  For attorneys with solo practices and small firms, I highly recommend PS Executive Centers.

I just wanted to get a cup of coffee and do some work for a couple hours--like I'm able to do at any other cafe in SF. I get that this is a ""co-working"" cafe, but why is everything is SO UNCLEAR AND CONFUSING?! 

I order my coffee and look for a place to sit. There's a gate and an iPad with some vague instructions to put in your phone number. I follow the steps, and enter my info (including my credit card), all while still completely confused by how this entire setup/model even works. I'm taken to a landing page where I need to enter a seat number. I walk past the gate, type in a number, and sit down.

Next thing I get an email saying that I've been charge $15!! First off, if you're gonna charge me, make that abundantly clear with a check out button--just like every single purchase made on the internet. Second, if I buy a coffee from your cafe, I expect to be able to sit and do at least some work at no added cost. 

I'm completely fine with paying to do work in a clean space with lots of amenities. That said, make your business model clear to your customers!

The area where you can plug into their large monitors is amazing if you're a coder. You can order food and drinks right from their app and they will serve it to you at your seat. No need to interact with a human! Only critique is that the mens restroom can use a bit of a renovation and perhaps an additional toilet.

Unfortunately on this visit, customer service amounted to being treated as if we were a nuisance when we tried to get access to the space in the morning. 

There is an overall attitude of attempting to automate everything to remove any human contact, and that coldness comes through clearly should you actually need to interact face to face to get help during your reservation (unless you might be a potential customer for their start up, then they can turn into such nice people curiously quickly, if they think you might be able to help them). 

I had reserved the room at least a month in advance through a 3rd party website (Liquidspace). Suddenly, 24 hours before Liquidspace would charge me I was told by Known Space that I needed to cancel my Liquidspace reservation and book directly through their startup booking company, which seemed highly questionable. 

Overall, if you want to feel like you should keep quiet and be seen but not heard, then this is the place for you. As a customer, I was told when I should arrive and how to do my job (in front of my clients!). If you want to feel like you have a boss in the office and have to to watch your every move to not get in 'trouble' by management, then this is the place for you. 

When I asked for help to access the building in the morning, I was asked to have the other attendees trying to access the conference room to stop calling them. They wouldn't have to call if the building access actually worked! This is not the customer's fault, and acting like it is is very poor customer service.

They usually greet me by name when I walk in and have been responsive to problems I have. I've hosted events here as well and the staff was more than accommodating. 

The building has an old-SF, industrial motif mixed with modern painted walls/wallpaper you generally see at WeWork buildings. One of my favorite things about it is how nice the light is. I've done some shoots at this location and the sunlight is easy to find. Of course they have blinds if you want to hide from the sun. The location, while Tenderloin, is very convenient. I ride a motorcycle and there are a few locations where you will always find a free parking spot. You usually groups of motorcycles parked nearby. You can't find that further downtown!  

It's located between Civic Center and Powell stations so it's an easy walk on a rainy day. Lots of great eating options as well.

2916,ChIJOdOpAdmBhYARfJE1okWfEjI,Industrious San Francisco Financial District,"345 California St Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA",5.0,"Preface: I worked at this location (Financial District) of Industrious for one month during a visit to San Francisco in May-June of 2019.

Industrious is a pretty top-notch coworking space. Their interior architecture design, is in my opinion, easily one of the better ones of the coworking spaces in the area. The offices, phone rooms, and common areas are a fair bit more spacious than other popular coworking spaces too. Overall, I feel that Industrious strikes a good balance between liveliness and professionalism when it comes to design.

Compared to the average coworking space, it’s worth pointing out the provision of free snacks (fruits, bread, yoghurts, pop, etc.) and small food related events which are regularly organized; an example of such food events include an ice cream / popsicle event, a whisky and coke happy hour, a popcorn bar event, a DIY yoghurt bar event, and recently for world productivity day an assortment of brain foods. Even if you don’t partake in these food events, it is pretty cool to see events of these types, which take place about 2-3 times a week, as it sort of shows the commitment from Industrious to go the extra mile in adding value for their tenants.

More particularly to this Financial District location of Industrious (I haven’t been to the Embarcadero location), the building (345 California Center) is pretty good looking from the inside and outside, it is equipped with the the new efficient type of elevators where you enter your floor number before you get on the elevator. However the windows on the building are not full wall windows, and since there are tall neighboring buildings, the opportunity for a good view from the office (if that’s important to you) is probably one thing lacking in this space.

The part which stood out to me a lot during my work visit duration at this location of Industrious, was the community management/operations staff. It is hard to convey in a short text based review here the difference for a coworking space, which usually involve additional community interaction through small events and other interactions, between having alright-good staff and having great staff. The current staff whom include Jonathan and Caroline definitely fall under the latter category for me, they’re delightfully cordial and professional. I witnessed a really pleasing environment run by them during my time here.

Overall, I look forward to seeing Industrious expand to more locations in and around the financial district.",5

Me: We do team building activities pretty regularly, so could you tell me what kind of events we could do that *would* work in the space? We may be able to partner up in the future. 

Her: Well, we don't do casino events. 

Me: That's fine. You said you do host team building events. Can you tell me what kind? 

Her: We don't do gaming. We do art things. 

Me: Ok. Could you give me an example of the kind of art things you're talking about? So, could you tell me what another group has done there as their own team building event that worked with the space? 

Her: Art things. That's what we do. Not gaming.

- The space is amazing. High ceilings. Brick walls. Wood floors. Lots of natural light.

- The location at the NC Music Factory is perfect. It's technically in Uptown so we get the benefits of being in Uptown, but we do not have to deal with so many of the negatives of Uptown. We have free parking and there are ways to get in and out of the Music Factory where you can miss most of the standstill traffic that can make Uptown a nightmare. Plus, the restaurants and bars that share the complex with us are great.

- The fact that it is ""coworking"" and not just an office with a shared entrance. We regularly work with people who have businesses here to make our smaller marketing agency work like a much bigger one. There are graphic designers, web developers, social media experts, photographers, accountants, and lawyers all here working together. There are also several cool start-ups that we know about before anyone else. Plus, we have gotten a lot of new clients since we work in the B2B marketing industry.

Industry Coworking is all the best things about having an office without any of the drama. It's open 24/7, there are conference rooms to have meetings in, there are people to hang out with, there is free coffee, and free water.

But no one cares what time you get in or when you leave, what you're wearing, or anything that has to do with office politics.",5

I couldn't find anyone to ""buzz"" me in so I waited outside, hoping the late staff member would pick up his phone- but no dice. I presumed that this company wasn't that hungry for my business so I went elsewhere. I also wish they had better signage- like a sign that says ""Industry"" and then a phone number to call if you want to be let in. I mean, c'mon- is this a speakeasy?

The Camp North End location in particular is the hidden gem of all the locations. Yes, it's sorta hidden in the middle of Camp North End but that's the point! Camp North End is 23 acres and under active redevelopment by the owners. If you're looking to be in the new cool area of town, Camp North End is positioned to become the ""NoDa for businesses"" of Charlotte. Hygge is smack in the middle of it. There is a rotating food truck every Thursday. And this location just launched a partnership with the City of Charlotte and Google to bring fiber and tech classes to the area.

I stumbled upon Industrious, and reached out to their Community Manager David Poland, to see if they had any availability.  He was quick to respond and happy to accommodate us.  He was extremely communicative and gave me all the information I needed to prepare my team and our clients.

Upon arrival, the space was beautiful -- on the 27th floor with great views of the city.  David greeted us and let us know that there was food and beverages available.  He took me to our room and helped me get all our tech situated.  We ended up having a super productive meeting and our clients kept commenting about how great the space was.

2998,ChIJ4YbqdymgVogRvOixStWPuTM,WeWork,"615 S College St, Charlotte, NC 28202, USA",4.8,"Ya know, I hate to be that person... but it's actually quite a myth that open workspaces are optimal. Certainly, some circumstances calling for collaboration benefit highly from such an area, but in virtually no career are people going to collaborate 100% of the time. Sure, they have teeny tiny phone booths which can be used when you really need to hunker down and to do some focused work. But you can't reserve them. Not having a space to myself where I am expected to complete my work has become a real problem for me. There are literally no cubicle type walls whatsoever, all of the walls are made out of glass. My productivity has been obliterated. It's impossible for me to focus. Frankly, I'm considering leaving my job because of it. Sure, it's a trendy place to hang out, if you really want to hang out with your coworkers during non-working hours. Sure, they have free beer and fruit water. They DON'T have a cafeteria. That really sucks. Considering that I'm working smack-dab in the middle of downtown, this means that if I don't want to bring my lunch with me every single day, there are no convenient, healthy, or inexpensive options -  all of which will take precious time away from my lunch hour, simply to access. I'm not just trying to trash this place, I'm still giving it three stars for the good things about it. The best thing about WeWork is the friendly and helpful staff. But I cannot simply give full marks for the things that it does indeed lack. Further, I think WeWork is encouraging a dangerous movement in large-scale companies that are increasingly implementing company-wide open office plans - which I believe they will realize is a mistake - in due time. 

When I first toured the facility, one of the first things I noticed when walking down the hallway - is that it caused everyone to stop what they were doing and look up at you as you walked past. If companies cared about productivity, they might be more aware of studies that show that it takes 20 minutes to fully refocus after that kind of interruption. The pressure from management to complete work in an efficient manner has not reduced in correlation with the ability to do so... and that's a real problem.

*Edit:
It's also kind of interesting that I just put it in a three-star review, and yet Google is still reporting that WeWork has 19 five star reviews and no others.",3

The first 2 weeks there was a technical issue which negatively impacted my business as my call volume significantly decreased during that time... essentially the call went to a fast busy signal. Although I reached out to management several times with concerns that I was not receiving calls, the issue was not resolved in a very timely manor.  Once the issue was fixed, clients began making comment that they were not greeted before being forwarded to my direct line or that they thought they had the ""wrong number"" because they couldn't understand the greeting from the receptionist. On several occasions I called my number to observe for myself that the line was not being answered and when it was answered the greeting was muffled and inaudible. I feel as though I am a reasonable person and could understand there may have been need for an adjustment period, consequently, I was patient throughout the process, trying to give the girls friendly reminders to please talk into the receiver when answering the phone and trying to figure out why the receptionist wasn't answering the phone for extended periods of time during the day. Nevertheless, the situation did not improve. I contacted the supervisor, who was aware of the situation, to express my concerns about the unsatisfactory answering service, technical issues and overall inability to provide the amenity I thought I was paying. I explained that because the issues were not resolved I would no longer be retaining thier services. I had a personal business line forwarded to Regus and consequently withdrew that line. I utilized Regus for less than a month and during that time the line was not working appropriately for two weeks and the service was embarrassing; overall, the negative impact on my business was inexcusable. Due to the circumstances, I requested to be released from my contract, which was approved and I was told I would not accure further charges from that point on. However, I was charged for the following month. When I inquired about the charge I was told it would be refunded. Not only was it not refunded,  I continued to receive invoices for several months. This all happened in September and here it is Febuary. No communication, no refund and a whole lot of clean up on my end. As a buisness owner, I'd advise anyone looking for an answering service to seek elsewhere. There are a lot of great alternative options around Charlotte, it's just not worth it.",1

We had booked the conference room to meet with a client, only to arrive and find the conference room was double booked on accident. Honestly, this would not have been a huge problem, I mean mistakes happen and I understand that, except that they had no where to put us… So they placed us in an unused office they were using as a storage room with too many desks and chairs.

1) The staff are amazing. We have gotten to know both Sara and Brittany during our time living here and they are awesome. They are actually a good crew that care about their jobs and the residents. They know my dog by name and give him treats when we walk by the leasing office. They are really helpful and Jamie is a phenomenal building manager. The maintenance crew is really helpful and friendly.

2) The building is really well maintained. The amenities are always clean and well taken care of and people actually utilize the common areas. The building includes a computer lounge, a gym, a rooftop with an awesome view of uptown, a dog park, a pool, grills, ping pong table and cornhole, and an area near the leasing office that you can rent out for events that has a pool table, plenty of seats, a coffee machine, fridge, etc. Not to mention the restaurants/shops under the building and within walking distance. Not to mention garage parking.

Elevators don't work every other week. People let their dogs pee and poop all over the property. The walls/floors are paper thin and you can hear everything.

I stayed in an Airbnb here and was told I could park in the Welcome Center spot in the parking garage instead of street parking due to a rare snow storm that was to hit at night. I parked around 7pm. The National Weather Service official winter storm warning began that night at 9pm. I woke up in the morning and my car was gone.  I called the towing company and they said my car was towed at 9:51pm.  They towed my car at night in the middle of a snow storm! What's worse is the section of the garage I parked in was more than half empty, so there was no reason to tow a car whether parked correctly or not. Also unethical to say the least because being from Florida I only have summer tires and I then had to drive back from the tow lot to the apartment on snowy roads in summer tires which is quite dangerous.  I spoke to another resident who said his girlfriend has been towed here as well, so it seems they just abuse their residents here for no reason which makes me think the towing company S&L Recovery must being giving kickbacks to someone in Camden building management because all this towing certainly isn't benefitting residents.",1

The thought of staying in a hotel while searching for, and finalizing accommodation after 40 hours on an airplane journey was daunting to say the least.  Fortunately for me, a friend recommended Camden Stonecrest and agreed to act as an intermediary for my securing an apartment.  While this certainly wasn't a 'business as usual' arrangement, Ryan accommodated us, and worked his way though the maze of foreign credit cards, no previous tenancy record or credit rating to go on.  Everything that could have been put in the 'too hard basket' was easily and professionally handled by Ryan and his staff to ensure my apartment was waiting for me upon arrival.  Prior to my arrival, furniture rental move in, utilities turned on, lease arrangements etc all went flawlessly thanks to his efforts.  An issue came up shortly after I moved in.  I brought it to Ryan's attention in the morning, and by early afternoon the issue was satisfactorily resolved.   The apartment is great, amenities wonderful, and am looking forward to using the newly refurbished pool in the months to come.

Water pressure in the shower is great, love that the kitchen sink has a garbage disposal, and the AC heats and cools super quickly.

The gym is spacious, the pool is nice, I love that there are multiple grilling areas. Overall no complaints and I highly recommend this spot! It’s definitely quieter than other South End apartments because the rail trail is cut off right where Camden Southline is, so there’s no public access behind the building. I did hear they are building a bridge over the light rail so it’ll be easier to get to Sycamore, rather than walking all the way around!

Where they really stand out though is their staff.  It doesn't get any better than them.  They were so helpful as I moved in and while I was living there.  Any maintenance issue I had was solved immediately.  Then I had to move mid-lease for a new job and they were very supportive during this time.  They were able to lease my apartment using their ""Rent Responsible"" program which was invaluable in allowing me to focus on my new job and moving to a new area.

I've been moved out for over 2 months now and they still immediately answer when I reach out with a question.  I forgot to forward my mail and they held it and shipped it all to me-- at their expense.

After 4 calls made with the only purpose of finding out what happened I asked the attendant to repeat where the refund was to be mailed and they still did not update the info when she read it back.

Although my boyfriend and I didn’t end up renting from here (we needed something a little closer to the city) we really liked the apartments. Most of all we really enjoyed the leasing agent, Madison. Madison is the reason we almost went with Camden. From the beginning emails she was always very attentive and accommodating. We looked at a lot of apartments and she was one of the few that actually made us want to live in the complex and knew her stuff. If you're looking into renting from here I definitely recommend reaching out to her.",5

The apartment complex is located in lush greenery which gives you a feel of a resort setting. Tommy and Linda at the leasing office are very warm and friendly. They go out of their way to make sure you feel at home. Rick and Brad provide the valuable and prompt maintenance service to make sure you feel comfortable. Also, the nearby shopping complex makes it convenient to get the weekly grocery and some retail therapy. I would highly recommend leasing here going by my personal experience. This place will always be special to me :) Thank you team Camden Touchstone!",5

3137,ChIJ6zNd0QydVogRU2XqTIfedmg,Camden Touchstone Apartments,"9200 Westbury Woods Dr, Charlotte, NC 28277, USA",4.5,I recently moved from Georgia to Charlotte North Carolina. When I was looking for an apartment I came to Camden Touchstone. First of all the customer service in the front office was outstanding. I have never walked into an apartment complex and felt so welcome in my life. I have been living here for 6 months now and I absolutely love my apartment. The workers here are outstanding. The customer service is amazing. If you call and do a work order they're very prompt with their repairs. I couldn't think of a better place to live,5

You can get a lot more bang for your buck elsewhere. I moved into this community as a transplant from upstate New York in December 2014. It was beautiful and the staff was awesome. Over the years, I have watched the number of employees in the leasing office come and go with all decency, tact and decorum leaving too. I have lived with an untreated mold and mildew problem for the better part of two and a half years or longer. I was told it's my responsibility to wipe down the six very large windows in my apartment to avoid moisture build up that lead to the formation on the windows, which they WOULD NOT admit was mold. Additionally, mold was formed on my bathroom ceiling and I was further advised that I needed to shower with the exhaust fan running and my bathroom door open to avoid this from occurring. I was provided a small dehumidifier to dry out my apartment after having a giant bulky commercial sized dehumidifier in my master bathroom for a whole week. Today, I have mold forming on my master bedroom ceiling around the air duct vent, I suppose it's also my responsibility to get up and wipe the ceilings too. This place is simply not worth the money!! It looks great on the outside but the physical structure is old and needs renovating. If you have neighbors above you, you will hear each and every step they take. My current neighbor has a large dog and I constantly hear thuds making it impossible to ignore at times. I had a mysterious goo seeping up from underneath my wooden floors that went unaddressed for nearly 6 months until I telephone Camden's Corporate Offices. The leasing office is completely unresponsive and unprofessional which is a direct reflection of poor management. Any concern raised with the previous property manager was always addressed in a timely manner. I have a litany of things gone wrong under the current management and staff, which precipitated me buying a house. After 4 years and 3 months as a Camden resident you would imagine the District manager would have the decency to accommodate my request to end this unhappy relationship 21 days early since I've closed on my new home. This is just another display of Camden's reluctance to take accountability for their less than adequate service. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere before renting here.

It's worth noting, anytime I've had to deal with maintenance for routine service request they've always been performed with care and quite professionally. They're a great group of guys!",1

It’s in a good location, and I’m sure the rent is fairly steep. My friend’s apartment was fine, nothing spectacular but in decent shape. The building is a bit dated.

Parking is ample. Right in front of Z Works. It is on 75 East Pine Street. Come in from 421 North or South. You must know someone there. The place has a electronic lock on the entrance. Call a head to be let in. The only thing I didn't like was a echo in the office that was rented. It's hard to get use to.

I purchased furniture at this location in 2017, with a SquareTrade warranty. My furniture was delivered appropriately to my address. The employees were wonderful and the store stocked neatly with many office furnishing options. 

Upon trying to redeem my warranty through SquareTrade, I realized I was a victim of fraud. SquareTrade paid out my claim to some other individual. Upon going through the ringer with squaretrade, I was instructed to go into the Staples location to verify my purchase. SquareTrade ultimately denied my claim. However, the store’s General  Manager at Staples here spent hours on the phone with her district managers and SquareTrade trying to resolve the dispute. Ultimately Staples reimbursed me. 

Excellent customer service at this location by thoughtful staff. A rare thing in the retail industry. Also, SquareTrade product insurance is a scam, and they require too little information in order to pay out claims- thus leading to increased risk of fraudulent claims. 

I’d give 6/5 stars to this Staples if possible.

I quit my corporate job to start a small business earlier in 2018. One of my immediate next steps was to find a quality co-working space. I started out by enrolling in WeWork for a couple of months. I am a two-person startup (for now) and was looking for a genuine co-working environment that is primarily full of other boot-strappers like me. In that regard, WeWork was fine (and had all the right amenities) but the environment there felt corporate and a bit sterile for my needs.

I then searched for an alternative workspace and went through a number of alternatives (other Seattle WeWork locations, Atlas, and a few other places.) In the process, I found MAKERS, enrolled with a Full-Time Flex Membership, and have been in love, ever since.

The place is run by an incredibly thoughtful and professional team (Veronica, David, and the rest of the team are fantastic,) who go way above and beyond whenever I have a question or concern. The physical space itself feels authentic, alive, and connects with me. It's conducive to being creative and productive. 

The location on Lenora and 1st is superb. It's incredibly convenient to settle in in the morning, then leave my backpack and physically visit business partners nearby, or host customers in the space. 

I've loved being a MAKERS member for almost half a year now and am looking forward to years to come. 

Thanks, David, Veronica and team for providing such a great startup hub in the heart of Seattle.",5

The offices are clean, modern/industrial looking, and quiet. The other teams pretty much keep to themselves which can be nice when you just want quiet days in the office. Its a wonderful place to work! Anyone from a large corporate company, to a individual contractor will love working here.",5

I went to an event which I bought a ticket for. I have not used their member services so this review is not about those. I like what they are trying to do and have been interested since hearing about the Riveter a few months ago. What I saw of the place did seem nice and the staff that I interacted with were nice. The event that I went to was about sustainability in businesses. Frankly, I felt like it was a bit of a Starbucks advertisement, which was a bit disappointing. There were a couple of other panelists who I felt had so much to share and they had actually started their own businesses. I was disappointed that there was not more of an emphasis on their experience and instead the emphasis was on a corporate giant. Starbucks does great work but the members at the Riveter and the target audience are people much more like the other panelists starting from the ground. Also as a side note, I didn’t see anyone else that looked like me there. While I was not necessarily expecting it, it would have been nice since the Riveter seems to be geared more toward inclusion, but this is Seattle. I might try another event at some point.

I decided to get a membership to WeWork Holyoke and it made a world of difference. I had put my career on hold for 10 years to raise kids, and going back to the workforce was a daunting task. WeWork Holyoke not only made a difference in the efficiency of my progress, but it also made a huge difference in my overall confidence. The staff went out of their way to ask how things were going each day and also encouraged me when I thought it was too big of a dream. That encouragement was exactly what I needed to make the final push to get back to my career. They even went so far as sitting down with me to do a mock interview before an interview. The free delicious coffee, beer, and weekly happy hours were a fun perk, but the friendliness of the staff is really what made me sad to leave. I ended up getting a job and had to say goodbye to WeWork, but at one point I said ""maybe I should start my own business, so I can stay at WeWork forever.""

Far better than trying to work from a coffeeshop and priced reasonably. The open office concept feels like working at a well funded startup with tons of character. Will be working here again.

My stint at The Hive was brief but worth talking about, so here's my long review ...

Convenience and Peace of Mind: I work from Denver for a couple of months out of the year. Usually I would setup shop in a cafe but I really needed a dedicated workspace for my 27"" Thunderbolt, my company's legal documents, and other things I need to run my company. The Hive offered the 24 hour access via keyfob, private floor access, locked office space, lockers for personal effects, and security cameras. 

Location: Right at the south end of 16th, just a skip away from the lightrail station. This meant I didn't need to drive or find parking and reduced my overall commute worries. Access to great food and other amenities was nice to have, deliveries were simple, and this provided a good central hub for meeting with colleagues and business partners.

Amenities: Sweet Bloom coffee and other snacks were included. In addition to those items, they had a conference room and ""phone booths"" for extra privacy. They have an HDTV for displaying presentations and whiteboards for collaborating. All office supplies, including printers, were easy to access and made working.

Ambience: The open office concept isn't for everyone, but I love it. The high ceilings, desk layout, office furniture coordination, lighting, and decor really made the space look fantastic and provided a general feel of wellbeing. With the other occupant's Spotify selections playing all day at just the right volume, it really felt casual, modern, and classy all in one. 

The People: JD, Greg, Brett, Nick, Kevin, Pete, Danielle were all fantastic people to collaborate with, bounce ideas off of, get feedback from, and just share a conversation with. We started ""Thirsty Thursday"" where we kick back and share a drink and chat for 30 minutes. I feel like I have some lifelong friends as a result of my time at The Hive.

The Owners: Lindsay and Jared are awesome. Just a great pair that I look forward to working with again in the future.",5

Especially if you'll be having client meetings you prefer to host in a stylish yet more executive-like and upscale backdrop.

I ultimately decided on another “popular co-working space,” based on proximity and my preference for an ultra laid back office environment after spending nearly 20 years in a formal corporate setting, but only after seriously considering Firmspace as an option I’m likely to reconsider again down the road.

The fact I never have to meet with or maintain a certain client image made my decision less complicated, as did being able to bring my dog to work as he's gotten older.  Though, the absence of dogs occasionally barking in the backdrop at work may be yet another reason others prefer Firmspace over my choice. Among options in town, Firmspace certainly has a more sophisticated and professional atmosphere.

To each her/his own no doubt and particularly since the vibe and amenities of every co-working space vary as much as individual preferences - and I toured nearly all of them.  Lots of great options in town with Firmspace being an awesome choice depending upon your preferences and business needs 👍",5

They allow dogs and you can pet the dogs that other people bring here. I much prefer this to working from home. I initially gave them a lower star review because the staff had a constant habit of saying “I can’t help you, that’s set by corporate and it’s just how it is.” An example is when the printer incorrectly charges you, but they don’t do anything about it. Hopefully they will change this attitude. They used to run out of paper towels every afternoon, but after I pointed this out in my last review, they now only run out of paper towels some days. Adding a second towel dispenser may never happen. Depending on which office you get, you can have noisy neighbors. For several months my neighbors did tech support and were on the phone (loudly) all day; they have since moved and it’s quiet now. The cleaning staff emptied out my desk one day and threw away notes, work travel receipts, and food; the front desk staff seemed surprised by this.

We’ve reserved their conference rooms for client meetings in the past and absolutely plan to do so again. They have a variety of sized conference rooms, very reasonable rates, and great amenities like wifi, tv screens, beautiful kitchen, plenty of snacks—need I go on?!

3665,ChIJ2zgmIut4bIcRn2kFUlBNat4,WeWork The Lab,"The Lab, 2420 17th St, Denver, CO 80202, USA",4.6,"After touring nearly every co-working space in Denver, I’m glad I decided to call WeWork LoHi my “home away from home” a year later, and love that going to work doesn’t feel like “work.”  Awesome location, a laid back and good non-corporate vibe, great amenities, a super friendly and dedicated staff, an ability to work out of any of their offices when traveling and dog friendly to boot.

That said, it’s probably not an ideal space for everybody and depending on your line of business and clientele.  For example, you may be less stoked than me if seeking an office affording a higher level of privacy or backdrop better suited for engaging with pretentious clients, holding divorce mediations, operating a boiler room trading desk, or colluding with Russian operatives as part of a political campaign. As you might expect on the flip side, lots of tech and other start ups but also a good mix of other professional types (marketing, realtors, financial planners, engineers, attorneys, and countless other small businesses and remote employees). In other words, it’s not all coders and web designers.

The only downside I feel obliged to mention is that acoustics are not great even if you rent a private office as noise and conversations tend to travel.  However, this is true with nearly every co-working space I toured (and even my old corporate office to some extent), and it’s probably a non-issue if you’re not easily distracted or used to working in a group or open office environment. Ultimately, I remain sold on the fact WeWork has a friendly and laid back yet professional and energetic work atmosphere, in addition to having more favorable pricing and its act together more so than many places I toured.

To each her/his own no doubt and particularly since the vibe and amenities of every co-working space vary as much as individual personalities. Lots of great options in town with WeWork being an ideal choice depending upon your preferences and business needs 👍",5

Once I committed, the staff has been outstanding, getting me set up, moved in, following up on requests.  The others on the floor are very professional, but not over social.  Many take the time to introduce themselves, and say Hi, but not alot of chat.  My business guests have also been greeted sincerely, and they have told me how nice and cordial the front desk receptionists were.

It's too far downtown and I haven't gotten involved enough to make it worthwhile. They have fun events but SF is a weird place for private clubs, especially the location.",4
3771,ChIJT1AuoKuBhYARVTeMrSCOcyw,The Wing SF,"115 Sansome St Suite #200, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA",3.9,"I joined The Wing the first week it opened, seduced by the impressive build-out at beautiful 115 Sansome. Before committing to a year-long membership, I specifically asked the membership representative if there would be a cap on membership to control volume. They gave me a resounding YES.  I joined The Wing as a place to work during the day when I have to be downtown so rely upon the availability of seating and phone booths.

Eight weeks into membership, it's clear The Wing either lacks or has a faulty strategy about controlling crowding at the facility. The lack of seating (there are women taking conference calls and working on laptops in the beauty room) and squatting in the phone booths far in excess of the hour long limit has made the space not a functional choice to work, and certainly not a reliable place to plan my day around.

Their overly generous guest policy lets members have 2 guests for up to 4 hours each. I don't know what The Wing is thinking, as this encourages the daily population there to swell 2-3x. And still there are representatives touring prospects. This is apart from the fact that following a lawsuit settlement, they are now permitting men to join, which defeats the entire concept and rebukes all members' expectations as to the environment they would experience.

When I voiced my complaint and requested a refund based on the fact that their representations about controlling membership were not true, they suggested that I attend programming events (which are not of interest to me, and from my experience working later in the day, are even MORE crowded) and sent me a copy of the terms and conditions and reminded me of their ""No Refunds"" policy.

I am not a frequent poster, but am extremely disappointed in the level of customer service so am posting this review as a warning to those who may be considering joining.

I also reiterate the other review posted here, in that The Wing policies are nonsensical in that they are punitive to ladies who are willing to pay the company $2500 up front, there are no any refunds available, but if there are life changes for mo-to-mo members, they will cancel membership.",1
3772,ChIJT1AuoKuBhYARVTeMrSCOcyw,The Wing SF,"115 Sansome St Suite #200, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA",3.9,"Great place to network. A bit loud to get any serious number crunching done - Bring headphones. Very beautiful decor, lots of entrepreneurial women, conveniently located",5
3773,ChIJT1AuoKuBhYARVTeMrSCOcyw,The Wing SF,"115 Sansome St Suite #200, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA",3.9,"Agree with Laura.  The place gets absolutely packed, and therefore loud.  If you're planning on using The Wing for work, I recommend looking elsewhere.  There are a few phone booths for calls, but they're always full of people who seem to park there, despite signs limiting time to 1 hour.  And there is nowhere quiet to go between the music (not ambient, mind you) and chatter.  The other day I joined a conference call from the main room as there were no phone booths.  After the call, I received a frustrated call from my boss saying it was ""way too loud"" in the background and it made it extremely difficult to have the call, despite the fact I was on mute when I wasn't talking.  
If you get up later in the day... maybe to get a drink or go to the bathroom... you can either leave your stuff where it is and trust no one will touch it, or you can bring it with you and likely lose your spot and then have nowhere to sit.  Morning are OK though.
You should also make sure you're asking all the right questions re fees before joining.  For some reason, I was not told that there would be a $200 initiation fee (fine, whatever) and that the conference room fee was $70/hr (not fine that I wasn't told) so I incurred $340 in unexpected costs in my first 48 hours.  But again, fees aside, my biggest issue is that it's packed and loud and not conducive to productive/work atmosphere.",1

The cost effective services in no way will diminish your client's expectations as the conference rooms and reception area are immaculate, and project a very professional image.  

Booking meeting spaces is extremely intuitive through the online portal.  Moreover, in the event there is a client that can only visit at a certain time, the staff will do their utmost to insure that your need is met.  

Further, our law practice relies heavily on the on demand executive assistant services.  The administrative assistants are all capable and professional, and they free professionals such that billable hours are better spent.  Our office uses these assistants for dictation, word processing, editing, and  mailing and shipping.  We further use them for scheduling client intakes and maintaining client relations through status updates.  Our practice is much more efficient with the ability to pass the mundane tasks off.

In terms of privacy, there are plenty of options for having confidential phone calls--conference rooms, the lounge area, phone booths etc. I made good use of all of these!

I've also used or been a temporary member of a few other coworking places in the city. In summary, if you live north of the city and need a no-hassle place to work, this is your place. It is my go-to for a few reasons:

-It's super easy to get in and out of. It's right off Rt. 1, right before the traffic builds up. It's also got a huge parking lot. I've always hated worrying about finding and paying for parking in the city. It's a decent walk from a T stop though so if you're reliant on that, might not be the best place. Bus stops aplenty though.

-It's got a small, quite community. Lots of space but not an overwhelming group of daily members yet. I always feel like I have to fight for a desk or a conference room at the other coworking spaces. Never been an issue here. If you strive off the hustle and bustle of a ton of activity, might not be the place for you.

TechTown leadership makes itself available for networking and referrals, and it's a rare day that I don't encounter someone from Detroit visiting the building to do something interesting. Access, technology, parking and support are all top-notch. Popcorn on Fridays, table tennis, and friendly people are a bonus.

Do yourself a favor and avoiding dealing with Regus at all costs. It's not just the local branch, it's the whole organization (the overwhelmingly negative web publicity is absolutely true!).

I had a coworking desk at Regus in the Renaissance Center from November 2018 through March 2019. Against my better judgment I ignored the terrible reviews of Regus on the web, thinking this individual center could be different. Man, was I wrong. My experience began with being assigned to a different desk than I was shown a few days earlier (a less desirable one). Even though it was Regus's mistake, they forced me to pay twice to sign up for the desk I was initially shown (this included paying the deposit twice, so I was out $700 on my first day). I had to wait at least a month for the refund for this initial payment. Otherwise, the experience while there, apart from the view, was consistently poor, primarily due to the indifference of the center staff: 1) they are constantly showing the coworking spaces because there is so much turnover, so your work is continuously being interrupted; 2) they don't warn you of construction ahead of time (more working days lost) 3) the communication between HQ and the local center is bad, so you must always double your communications, and basically repeat to one what was already settled with the other (including payments). I could really go on and on with the indignities (they are also endlessly trying to find ways to cram more people into the coworking spaces, so don't assume the office layout you signed up for is permanent). To top it all off, I cancelled to the letter of my agreement (which was month to month and I gave the required 30 days notice), but I still can't get Regus to terminate my account and stop sending invoices (I paid my final invoice on time). They made up a ""virtual office"" extension charge which I never asked for and of course didn't need. It's now been three months since I've cancelled and I still haven't gotten my deposit back. I don't ever expect to honestly. To sum up, I guarantee you'll be a much happier person if you choose one of the better spaces in the city, and there are several of them (like my current one, an absolute world of difference).",1

I typically do not like to do my homework in a coffee shop; however, this coffee shop was different. It was much more quite than other coffee shops. Everyone there was actually doing work rather than socializing. It was shocking to me because people will typically be more social in a coffee shop. But I was okay with that because I like to do my home work in more quite environments. On the other hand, the seating was not the most comfortable. The lower tables have wheels on all four legs, and they do not properly lock. This made it a little annoying if I slightly moved the table would roll in every direction.

I ordered The Office Monster smoothie. It was made with yogurt, peanut butter, banana, and spinach. When the cashier said spinach, it threw me off because of the other ingredients in it. I never really had a smoothie with that type of a combination; rightfully so, I gave it a try. The peanut butter and the spinach were the two dominant flavors in the smoothie. It was a good balance of flavor. But the smoothie is a little over priced at $7.50; at most, I believe roughly $5.00 for it is more reasonable.

I had great service. The cashier was kind and respectful. He made my order quickly and had a high sense of urgency to make my order. Thank you for the great service.",4

They have a nice selection of sandwiches and snacks, some bottled drinks, and they also sell other merchandise like shirts, coffee mugs, etc. The prices are pretty standard, but the quality is slightly better than other coffee chains, in my opinion.

Two of those conference rooms don't have standard, functioning conference room equipment so they're not of much use anyway. There is a business lounge but it is locked outside of 8-5. The company closes on government holidays even though their tenants don't so access to management, business lounge, mailroom is not available. Half the bathroom stalls in the ladies room don't lock. They also just switched out our chairs from nice, ergonomic chairs to the cheapest, most uncomfortable chairs an office supplier has to offer.

The office has the essentials like good desks, lighting, WiFI, printers, etc.  But it also has spaces for making private calls and having meetings which is a huge plus.  The best surprise about working here has been getting to meet other remote workers and enjoying some social events like lunch and happy hours.

4320,ChIJIWR6WgAKlVQRa_ze32cWSBk,Collective Agency Downtown,"511 SW 10th Ave #1108, Portland, OR 97205, USA",4.4,"I have been a member of Collective Agency for eight months (since August 2018). I work from the Downtown office, and I highly recommend it as a productive, cozy workplace for freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.

Here are a few reasons why:

Location: I have found the 10th Ave. location to be a real asset. There are food carts right across the street. It is a short walk to Target, Whole Foods, Pioneer Place, and Powell’s if you need to run an errand. Walking to the waterfront makes for a nice break from work. 

I’ve had meetings with people in all five(!) quadrants and have easily been able to get to these meeting via public transit from near the office. 

Bonus: Need a dentist? This building is chock full of them (I got a filling and was back in the office in less than an hour). 

Ambience: Alex, the owner, takes great care to make the Collective Agency offices as comfortable and inviting as possible, using warm lighting, carefully controlled room temperature, art and textiles, etc. He’s constantly making improvements and solicits feedback on these improvements. Plus, the view is beautiful. 

Amenities: Pretty much anything you could think of that would make for a productive office is already at Collective Agency. That includes ergonomic chairs, computer monitors, printers, chargers of every variety, a paper cutter, screen cleaner, batteries, first aid kit, and so many other things—seriously, if you need it, it’s probably there. 

There’s a great selection of coffee and tea and tons of kitchen supplies. There are lockers to keep your stuff, a nice library of books, and even a telescope. There are small rooms that can be used to take private phone calls or meetings, and larger rooms are also available to reserve in the building if you need them. There’s a shower on the first floor if you want to take an exercise break or bike to work. 

People/Community: Collective Agency is a place where you can be very productive, in part because the cozy ambience and ample amenities leave you free to focus on work but also because of the other members. People work hard here and are passionate about what they do, and that can be contagious. 

While it’s often pretty quiet, there are lots of opportunities to get to know your coworking coworkers (if you choose—everything is optional). That includes weekly meetings, eating lunch together, going on walks to the farmers market or to get ice cream, and events like happy hours, game nights, grilled cheese brunches, bowling, and even a book club (my favorite). I’ve really enjoyed getting to know people here. It’s useful to be able to talk about the benefits and challenges of remote or freelance work (or starting a business) or just to have those water-cooler conversations you have in a typical office. When I worked at home I often felt isolated and lonely. I can honestly say that coworking at Collective Agency has been a boon to my mental health.

I may sound like a total shill, but I think others should know about about this gem of a community!",5
4321,ChIJIWR6WgAKlVQRa_ze32cWSBk,Collective Agency Downtown,"511 SW 10th Ave #1108, Portland, OR 97205, USA",4.4,"I've been a member here since April, and I absolutely love it. As a freelancer, I was looking for a space that would give me an opportunity to meet other working professionals, participate in social events and not break the bank. Collective Agency checks every box on my list. 

As a member, it feels like my opinions matter. There are weekly group meetings to talk about the space, events, etc. and Alex (the owner) is always available to chat if needed. It truly feels like a 'collective' where members are valued and appreciated. The many social events provide an opportunity to get to know the other members and the book club is always a hit. It's great to have people to eat lunch with again. 

The amenities are great. Indoor bike parking, showers, and all the basic office kitchen offerings make this space super functional. And you can't beat the location... it's surrounded by restaurants, coffee shops and stores. As a bike commuter, I especially appreciate the bike shop on the ground floor. They saved me from a flat tire, and provide any service you could need for your bike.",5

She responded quickly to emails, was so flexible with our scheduling needs, didn't hover over us all the time or feel the need to lay down a bunch of rules like other co-working spaces we've used, and made us feel very welcome. 

I commented more than once that I wish I had an office half as cool as this. The wifi was always fast. We did have some issues when using the Apple TV but that could be our computers too. The meeting room was a comfortable fit for 16 people for long lectures every night. The break room has all the amenities you need including microwave, refrigerator, coffee pot, water dispenser and they have dishes, glasses, silverware for more than a dozen people if needed. The shooting bays looked very cool, even though we didn't use them. 

The space was always clean and tidy and the furniture was in great shape. I love the openness of this space and we will absolutely call NXT anytime we need a space in Portland. They are great folks and I highly recommend this great local business!",5

4333,ChIJ4cgUEriglVQRjAYO6XMbfNc,HatchLab PDX,"2420 NE Sandy Blvd, Portland, OR 97232, USA",4.3,"Hatch is an interesting concept which combines co-work space with education for entrepreneurs, and local investment funding for it's clients.  Each client receives a designated amount of work-space and access to meeting rooms depending upon the plan they choose.  Clients are responsible for putting out educational material on making a successful business (or non-profit) that Hatch then uses to help educate other members.  Hatch works with local banks and investors to educate them on the benefits of investing directly into local businesses.  These investors are then connected with their clients and either receive a portion of the business or repayment with interest in exchange for the funds they invest.  In short a potential client would see Hatch as a place they can get support and education on turning their idea into a business as well as help getting local direct investors into their business.  They work with for profit and non-profit businesses but they do have a couple of requirements.  It must be in the business strategy to remain local.  They don't want start-ups that get an idea going planning to sell out to a national or international firm.  Second the business must be one that creates a positive footprint in the community.  That is entrepreneurs who bring a goods or services to market not resource depleting businesses like oil or natural gas firms would be.  The place has a good vibe and friendly atmosphere and is a viable choice for someone wishing to start their own business.",4

This company is a scam. You are paying for a virtual office space, but they make it difficult to understand how to pay online or set up auto payment, resulting in late fees that they won’t take off.

It is a virtual office, they weren’t taking my mail or phone calls. I was paying for an address. THAT IS ALL.

I said I was picking my wife up at 2 pm and would be there 2:15 to 2:30 pm. I was shocked, it gave me pause to wonder what kind of company I was really dealing with.

You said specifically that  you would wait for me, period! Otherwise I would not have wasted my time. You have been very nice, helpful in the past and called me and stayed in contact, I thought this was a professional organization. 

The receptionist was expecting us and told us you had left 2 minutes before we got there, I think we actually saw each other in the parking lot, but you left. The receptionist was the only person we saw in the building, and she had no information for a us at all! She didn't know anything, I asked her if you had told her about the large office or the two offices and all the details we had discussed and she said no. The only thing she did was show us a single office that I had seen before, that was not even remotely what you and I had been talking about at all.

I just got your message and frankly I am appalled.  You told me you would wait for me and I was on time, the receptionist had absolutely NO information for me in relation to what you and I had been talking about.

You and I had been talking about Many different options, a large office to divide or an outer office with a small interior office across the hall for my secretary. I mentioned to you on the phone that I had many other detailed questions for you and you knew I had to have the numbers for an important Funding meeting Friday.

When we spoke on the phone you never once indicated that you only had one office left. If that was the case then why were you telling me about all the options I had? Why did you tell me about the 2 office options if you had none? So that one office is all that you have? Why in the world weren't you honest with me and tell me that on the phone, instead of us driving all the way there expecting to be helped in finding a large office or two offices like we specifically discussed.  

I am very confused and disenchanted to say the least, I like to be able to trust the people where I have my office, and frankly none of this makes much sense and certainly has created a lack of confidence and credibility in your company. At best!

The first week of July we received the initial invoice for the ongoing service to begin in August.  But now, after a number of years at the Regus office they had included a security deposit with our fees equal to a month of service.  The issues with us and contractually are:

1.	There was no mention of a security deposit when Regus presented our new contract in May, either in writing or verbally;
2.	Had we been informed of a security deposit, after several years as a client, we would not have signed a new contract to continue with Regus and would have terminated their services in May, a full 3 months before our current agreement was to expire;
3.	As soon as the invoice came in with the additional, non-contractual charge, we immediately sent a letter of termination; and
4.	Regus, with the addition of this fee that was not presented at the time of the renewal contract had breached the upcoming contract, therefore making it null and void.

Since terminating our agreement with Regus we have received ongoing invoices from them, with late charge fees.  We have not only contacted their local office, but the office of the CEO of Regus USA in Dallas, Texas, to no avail.  We have offered, as their contract states, to go to arbitration to settle the dispute and have agreed to abide by the decision of that arbitrator.  Regus apparently does not wish to use these settlement services, which would force them to abide by the arbitration decision, even though that is the remedy for disputes as outlined in their own contract.  Instead they have now turned the disputed amount over to a ‘COLLECTION’ agency, with their target being the CEO of our company.  Could this possibly be perceived as being done this way for any other reason than to have an individual harassed?  We are a “C” corporation in the state of Nevada and the Regus contract was with the corporation, not any corporate officer individually.",1

Another colleague ordered online and was told to expect them the same evening. After calling several times, to no answer, she went the following morning to pick up, and was also told it would be several hours before they were ready.

4818,ChIJJRMw0ecEyIkRwxzipN6_mBQ,Charles Village Exchange,"2526 St Paul St, Baltimore, MD 21218, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA",4.5,"I've worked at the Charles Village Exchange for the past year now. It has been a great experience so far, both in office ambiance, location, perks and the price for a space is comparable to other co-working spaces in Baltimore. 

The office space itself is in the third floor of a renovated row home, which has been upgraded and revamped to have a modern feel. Inside, there are 7 half walled cube spaces with ample room in each space to set up your desk area as you see fit. It has all your basic office amenities like coffee, water, fridge, and full bathroom. In addition, you can be as collaborative or as heads down as you need during the day with the other workers in the office space. In general, the office is also pretty quiet except for the occasional train that passes by outside the window, but that’s not a big deal.

I think the biggest perk is the location. Nestled near many nice Baltimore neighborhoods like Charles Village, Remington, and Hampden, you’ll find ample options for coffee, lunch, happy hour and dining out.

If I had to nitpick, the only tricky aspect or working here is parking. There are no assigned spaces in the back lot for Exchange employees, so we have to park on the street, usually on 25th street right around the corner, or on St. Paul street out front, if you’re lucky. I usually find parking a little more difficult when school is in session. There’s an elementary school on the adjacent block so those spots on the street fill up pretty quick. While it’s not deal breaker, it’s something to keep in mind.

Lastly, if you’re on the fence about signing up, contact the owner/manager Eve Austin. She’s the nicest person to deal with and can give you a tour of the space at your convenience and can accommodate almost any request.",5

4826,ChIJZdV_5pIEyIkRinrGYxvh1Gg,Open Works,"1400 Greenmount Ave, Baltimore, MD 21202, USA",4.6,"Average customer service and lack of consistent standards. Was a builder level member for approximately nine months. The shop staff are somewhat illusive and have (in my opinion) mediocre customer service skills. They are frequently MIA or occupied by their own projects. I feel that they do not enforce fair shop etiquette standards. Sometimes members monopolize the table saw for hours or occupy valuable shop space with large projects left overnight.          

Woodworkers should know that hand held tools experience a lot of hard ware and tare. Drill and router bits are frequently missing, dull, and/or broken. Hand saws and chisels are often dull. Orbital sanders are used hard and often improperly cleaned from previous use. 

All things considered, it is still a really great value. The weekend hours are especially nice compared to other maker workshops. They are consistently improving member experiences and do a lot of community  outreach which I think is fantastic. I would just note that it is an intimidating environment for novices and the staff is not as helpful as they'll sell it to you.",4

Before joining PIVOT I worked from home for over 5 years and was ready to be in a environment with some  other business owners/professionals as well as the ability to free my mind a bit from working in the same place for so long!

What I like most about PIVOT is the 24/7 Access. I have always been the type of person with odd working hours, and the fact i am able to come and go as i please, anytime, is what sealed the deal for me.

From talking to other members it seems they like this feature as well. I have also heard other members talking about how they enjoy the ability to book and use the different avialble confrence rooms as well as the Free Coffee & Tea (Can't go wrong with that)

With all that said, I defenitly plan to stay as a member of PIVOT for a long time. I couldnt ask for a better co working space!",5

I work from my home office and our company also utilizes a ""virtual"" office. Unfortunately after 5 years, we became unhappy with our current location and were excited at the possibility of moving to Hudson Business Lounge after seeing the space and reading the reviews. 

I spoke with Scott in February wherein I explained everything we were looking for and was told repeatedly that this was something they could accommodate. I was provided with prices, hours, availability, etc. Excited to hear what awesome services they provide and anxious to move our business forward we terminated our current lease and contacted Hudson again to officially make the move. Scott remembered our conversation, asked when we would be needing to start our lease and advised they were able to start August 1st. He asked I email so we may discuss further. I did and again reiterated our needs including photos. 7 days went by without receiving any sort of response. I emailed again. No response. Our emails are tracked so I knew they were received and read. I again contacted Scott and he said they would be getting back to us shortly. Today I receive the following email: 

Hi Sara -

I received your note via Scott, and wanted to give you a shout!

Unfortunately, and at this time, Hudson would not be able to accommodate this type of arrangement.

Thanks for thinking of us!

Obviously, this was shocking to read. Especially without an explanation or at the very least an apology for not only making us wait 9 days to receive this news but for the miscommunication to begin with. 

Emails that followed only provided excuses and basically said ""good luck finding something else!""

Utterly disappointed and disgusted by how this was handled. Hudson Business Lounge states they are for helping small businesses but they are absolutely not and my experience, unfortunately, proved that. 

If you are also a small business owner STAY AWAY from Hudson. They may promise you the moon and stars to get your initial interest but know they may pull the rug out from under you. Their words mean nothing.",1

I looked into a number of the different providers in the area over the course of a few months, although some were nice, none of them could offer the amenities that Regus does. 

Looking back at them now I have to say its like a completely different environment. The new manager Yvonne has not only brought things back to the standard I grew to know, she has exceeded it. She seems to have a lot on her plate getting things in order, however she is always responsive and helpful whenever anything is needed.

This review is based on my experience with this organization as a whole, mainly their customer support team. 

I've had the absolute worst experience with the billing department of Regus. The horribleness all started when I first signed the agreement online and it's supposed to take you to a payment page. Their website errored causing the entire process to fail. 

You submit a customer help desk request and it took them literally well over a week to even respond. Their website and apps are glitchy and their contracts and deposits are ambiguous. 

They require you to cancel your contact on the website, what they don't tell you is that the website doesn't allow you to cancel. I tried to cancel my contact and it wouldn't allow me to. I opened a help desk request and received ZERO response. I opened another help desk request and finally a week later they got back to me and tell me that I have to pay for next month even though I won't be at that location. I moved in on February 26th, I had two days to cancel and the website wouldn't let me. Now I have to pay over $800 for empty office for a month even though I just signed a 1-year agreement for another location in San Diego. 

They claim to be the founders of flexible office space yet they aren't flexible in the least. I just signed a 1-year agreement with them for another location in San Diego. They're forcing me to pay for two offices in two locations because I couldn't submit a cancellation within 2 days on their terrible website. How is that flexible? 

I worked in commercial property management for over 10 years, I understand contracts, deposits, and requirements to manage a commercial space. This organization, however, doesn't have the slightest clue how to offer even the most basic customer service to their tenants. 

You're supposed to be able to manage your contract online, yet when you click on your agreement (aka lease) in the website, it is a one-page document that does not list your deposit amounts, only very basic details.

I will start by saying, the staff here are great and I have no issues with them. My problem is with the  Regus accounting and billing regime who are not willing to do any customer service. They treat you like dirt and talk down to you like you are nothing. I have a problem every October at lease renewal.  They charge extra months rent when I already paid my retainers then they refuse to refund the money and tell you that you just don't have to pay rent next month. Really? It's ok to keep a client's money hostage but if were a minute late on rent they charge a late fee. This year at renewal they did the same thing. Charged an extra month and charged for internet which was also included in my lease. My lease agent himself contacted accounting and clarified that the invoice was wrong. Accounting told me it will take a few days to be resolved. I called almost everyday and was told to wait it out. It was resolved on.10/12 and I was told to make the payment then for the correct amount. Guess what, now they charged $73 late fee and i am being told (talked down to and treated like dirt) by every representative that they will not reverse the fee because I was late? I gave in and paid it to avoid other late fees on the late fee. I am filling a formal complaint with the Arizona Attorney General's office and the better business Bureau since i can't resolve this issue in a civil manner with them. I am not trying to bash the company but this is my true experience. Take it how ever you want. Will be seeking court actin to terminate the remainder of the lease.

Not that many people use it, so, it seems like the space is generally available, but they don't have any dedicated study rooms for the phone calls in the private. The tables have many stains, doesn't look like they clean it often, considering how empty it is. The biggest deal breaker, however, is the WiFi — their Eureka SSID has a captive portal from the library, and it's just randomly slow and filtered/monitored in mysterious ways, or just your old packet loss from a residential-grade connection, resulting in random massive delays for various API calls or whatnot. Also, my phone had a really bad LTE connection, and their WiFi didn't work properly on the phone, like, at all. My own hotspot is usually my saver, but it was disappointing that my TMo actually worked even worse than the WiFi here — usually works great elsewhere in town. If they get their WiFi sorted, and TMo to get their LTE working properly, would def be a much better place.",3

While the building looks plain from the outside, I was blown away by the interior. The interior is defined by a two story tall large central room, with plenty of natural light. The desks and chairs are new, modern, and comfortable. There's no shortage of outlets, and usb charging stations, and the wifi has always been fast. Free parking is available around the building, but in the rare event that I couldn't find a space, there's a very large nearby parking lot. When it was time for a break, I would clear my mind by watching koi swim in the indoor pond (the running water also provides nice white noise that drowns out other office noises). The building is situated on a campus with a large grass open space and tall trees. There's also a basketball court and a set of pull up bars, which I've found have been a great way to get the blood flowing and re-energize after being stuck on a hard project. The workshop staff are also great. They're friendly and have always attended to my concerns quickly. Nothing but the best things to say about them. And finally, their prices are very competitive, especially considering what you're getting. I almost always prioritized function over fashion, but here you don't have to. This is beautiful space with excellent amenities and friendly people. If you're shopping around for a co-working space, I would definitely recommend scheduling a tour here, you'll probably fall in love with the place like I did.",5

I began working by telecommute in early 2014 and midway through the year my employer and I both agreed that having access to an office space would be great for my productivity.  I found Capsity online and met with Jeff and Brian and they showed me Capsity.  

At first, Capsity provided me with just another place to work and focus besides my home.  Once I began meeting the other members, though, I began realizing the unique benefits that working at Capsity provided.  I could talk freely to other freelancers, entrepreneurs, nonprofits and business owners about their jobs while answering questions for anything related to digital marketing.  If there is one thing that I love about Capsity, it's the diversity of of the people that work there.  We have digital marketers, nonprofits focused on urban gardening and community innovation, lawyers, architects, public speakers/motivators, and more that I continually get to meet.

Our office is separated from the rest of Industrious, but Industrious holds our lease and manages our facilities and such, and my co-workers and I have access to all of Industrious' open spaces (and snacks).  My husband, too, rents a dedicated desk, so I get to experience Industrious from both sides.

The Ponce City Market location is excellent.  The atmosphere is professional, clean, and intentional.  The style of the space is beautiful and interesting.  There are often fresh flowers at the reception desks and in the kitchen areas.  There are rent-able offices avaialble, open office available for meetings of tenants, open coworking spaces, areas just for dedicated desks, and 1-person ""phone booth"" rooms tenants can use for a private call.  

Other amenities include a mother's room for nursing, a kitchen space with dish washers, microwaves, and lots of snacks, pastries, coffee, loose leaf tea, fresh fruit, infused water, and healthy bars.  The spread available to tenants really is impressive.

Most of the walls between rented offices are glass, which allows the natural light to come into the entire office space and keep the place feeling energized.  Industrious has weekly happy hours and other events.  Tenants can take advantage of the PCM discounts in the restaurants and shops below.  There is also parking available ($150/month), though I'm not sure how many spaces would be free at this time.

The staff is quick to help out with any issues or questions, the space is beautiful, and if you like, you can also use your membership to work at any other Industrious location (there are 5 in Atlanta as of Feb 2018).  I only have good things to say about Industrious.  Highly recommend!",5

When my lease auto renewed, they changed the terms of the contract and charged my account $1,000 for a retainer that I was promised I would get back. 8 months later, I have still not received the money back. They have used confusion, stall tactics, and just outright ignoring me. I may never receive the money they took from me. If you’re a small business that values your hard earned revenue, I recommend finding another office not owned by regus or “Spaces”. They are a shady organization. I regret doing business with them.",1
5265,ChIJLZo4OW8E9YgROmn0mtqnSyY,"SPACES - Atlanta, Midtown East","715 Peachtree Street N.E Suites 100 & 200, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA",4.3,"I can't even say A For effort here. We had a short term lease. When we first signed this lease, I had seen a bunch of places and when the person showed me it was gated access for every single part of the private offices. However when we'd moved in, they'd changed that and the door on our side was open putting us on the side without a key fob access. Which I rolled my eyes about. And kept quiet. And then our door lock broke. So basically anytime I needed to even go to the bathroom, I had to bring my wallet/laptop/phone with me.  Because the door lock was broke and we were in the open space of a high rise in downtown Atlanta, anyone on the elevator could have walked out and grabbed anything we had in our space.  I emailed the front desk about this three times before anyone did anything. I went downstairs, the front desk just kind of shrugged their shoulders and went about their day. Told me they put a work order in. Finally by day four I was livid and was not able to LOCK our DOOR when I was leaving at night, so had to pack anything I needed. I was given the Operations directors email. Emailed her, nothing. I finally had to reach out to our sales rep, who was the only part of this entire ordeal who seemed to have any idea what he was doing. He was able after 4 days step in and move us. We were told it would be months before they could fix the lock b/c it had something to do with the wall.  So I asked if we could be moved to another office where we wouldn't have to move AGAIN a month before our lease was up. They obliged and as a ""Courtesy"" waived the move fee. Umm, your door is broke. You shouldn't even have brought up a courtesy fee. 

I was told by their ""outsourced ""tech"" team that my brand new apple wasn't compatible with their printers. (So every time I had to print something I had to leave the building to pay for it at a Kinkos, which is literally half the reason I rented office space)  

I signed up and paid for parking and was told it was fine until seven days in was told the building lot was full and they forgot to process my paperwork. I had to pay to leave the building four times while this happened, and was charged to my account. So as this was happening, I paid for not only a monthly parking fee, but to exit the building when they screwed up. So it was also delayed and they just charged me for it, I sent an email asking them to remove the charges. And they just didn't respond. So i got charged an exit fee, that I point blank asked if it existed when signing this lease, was told no. And then found out it did. 

Here comes the kicker. We left on 5/31, and were told that our deposit of 1K would be returned within 30 days. I emailed around 6/10 asking ""hey is there an idea of when this would process"" I got a response back from the front desk saying that it wouldn't even be touched until after 30 days past the lease end. Which meant after 6/30. I said, no that's not what is in the terms or what was said. I was told within 30 days. The response was ""Hi Leah,The retainer refund process takes a minimum of 30 days to complete from your agreement's end date which was May 30, not your move-out date. The retainer is still processing and will return to your bank institute of choice after June 30.""

So what you're saying is it won't be within 30 days, and basically I can't even get an answer until after 6/30. I responded, no that's not what is in the lease agreement, it is within 30 days, by GA law you're required to get it to me within 30 days. I asked AGAIN for the third time to speak to someone above this person, and now still haven't heard a word.  He then responded to my email with the highlighted rule staying it was due within 30 days. I still have no clue what is going on or when we will see our deposit, but as a small business it is imperative that i budget/ plan. Never again.",1

I started with a 2/4 month contract deal with them. As soon as I did, I never got a bill for the amount I originally signed for. $600 or so per month. My first bill was like $1,800 or so. They claimed that I never paid my first month. Might I add you’re required to pay your first and last month to even receive a key to your office space. But when I got my first bill they claimed that I never paid the first months fee... in addition I had to pay my next months charge. So I bit the bullet and paid almost $2,000 to settle the debt. Ok let’s fast forward through months and months of irregular charges. I decided to leave this business after going a few months on a month to month agreement. One stipulation is once you leave without notice you loose your deposit. The first and last month. Which is more than fair!! They’re running a business and I get that. But after expecting to only be liable for the first and last months rent. Tell me why their lawyer contacts me and tells me I owe them $9,000!!! So now we might possibly have to settle this issue in court. From the way that it looks to me. This brand grows there business by stepping on the little guy and demanding money from shady contracts. I think their contracts auto renew. So I think they’re trying to charge me for a auto renewing contract after I had already left, mailed in my keys, and cleared out my office. Be very careful with this shady company. Worst experience of my life. Go with We Work, Industrious, or someone like that. RUN, RUN, RUN!!!!! FROM THIS BUSINESS!!!!!",1

As a smaller company we value energy, space, amenities (coffee, call rooms, meeting rooms, parking), and support which ROAM has delivered over the past 3 months we've been a member. Location wise, ROAM Buckhead is smack dab in the middle of the tech mecca that is Piedmont and Lenox road, walkable to gym's, grocery stores, and restaurants. If you need space for face to face meetings, you can rest assured that the meeting rooms at ROAM are all incredibly modern and outfitted with all the technology accessories. All of this combined with the fact that they are more affordable than many of the other local co-working options makes ROAM a great contender for any company that is looking for this type of space.

Unfortunately, SharedSpace “pulled the rug” of stability from under my business by changing membership pricing just four months into the year (we negotiated the current rate at the start of the year). Unlike some of the co-working space competitors that keep a rate stable for a year, SharedSpace just sent 3 days ago an impersonal email forcing me to either pay the hefty fees to change my office address on business cards, deliverables and formal registrations that charge fees for mid-year address changes (like with the Secretary of State and professional licenses) or I just have to “pony up” to pay the 150% increase beginning mid-year for HALF of the services currently received.  This is not the stability that small businesses need — my team has switched to Roam, which is nearby, has better sound-proof rooms and offers an annual contract to minimize these type of careless and unnecessary mid-year surprises.

The Service is terrible from the floor realtor(manager), Tom. Jazz at Concierge is very attentive and very sweet. A little about my experience, I had a office at Nexus for a whole year. Close to the end of that year, Tom forced me to move my office because another company wanted my office because he wanted to “keep his employees all on the same side of the office.” So he emails me one day and was like “Alexia are you willing to move your office to another office on the other side of the floor.” I told him no because I had already set up all my office decor and organized my workspace in the space I had been in for the whole year. So he lets a couple days go by and sees me in the office and says “The guy won’t be needing the office anymore so I can stay.” So I said ok, because I didn’t want to move either way which was my choice for my office that I pay faithfully on time each month right? So he comes back a couple days later and he’s like you have to move your office because I have to accommodate this other business because they’ve been here longer than you. I was completely disappointed with this company. Moving forward I went virtual and end up leaving like 3 months later when I could find a new office. Terrible experience here. If you’re looking to get some good business, this is definitely not the company for you. Funny because the same company added another employee and still end up having to move that employee to the other side of the floor so his employees still weren’t together. God doesn’t like ugly.

I leased for nearly two years.  I discovered that my outgoing mail was not being sent - the idiot at the front desk was not mailing it even though he was receiving the labels each day as agreed.  On top of that, they lost an insane amount of my incoming mail.  One day, I had to send an outgoing overnight fed ex with a check.  Mr. Idiot at the front desk couldn't get the fed ex to work so he sent it 2-3 day priority mail without telling me.  Two days later when the contractor called about his check, I asked for the tracking number and he said, ""I made the decision to send it priority since I couldn't get fedex to work.""  I told him NEVER DO THAT AGAIN ON OVERNIGHT MAIL.  He told one of the associates I was mad at him and didn't like him any more.

I've received dozens of other people's bank statements, tax bills, returned mail and invoices that are current tenants in the Regus building because he and others are too stupid to put the mail in the right person's name/folder, box or office.

Parking was free and easy. I entered the lobby, which is beautiful and full of light. I was greeted by a nice lady who advised me where to find elevators. 

I proceeded to 11th floor and walked into Industrious Perimeter where I was greeted by Payal Patel who was friendly, welcoming, patient (I asked about 100000 questions), and detailed. 

She is passionate about helping people and I could see her service attitude. 

I enjoyed talking with her and found the details she brought to my attention very important and valuable.

LOBBY / CAFE

The lobby is called cafe here. It’s a large space with comfy booths, tables, and chairs. See pictures from the entrance. This is where those who have coworking membership work. They allow only nine people at a time to have coworking membership. It’s beautiful and quiet. I really enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere. There’s no disturbing music like in other coworking places where I worked (Prototype Prime and Buckhead Club). The large windows at the cafe allow for natural lighting which is wellness-promoting. I visited WEWORK at Peachtree 100 and saw that members there had to unpack and prepare their lunch in the lobby kitchen, which was odd. This coworking space offers a back kitchen for that. 

DRINKS / SNACKS

There were two fancy coffee options and OMG the coffee was so so so good! They have plastic cups or regular mugs to choose from which I liked, because I prefer mugs. They have icing machine, too. They offered vegan 🌱 milk and creamer, and the options are plenty: coconut, almond, etc! They provide various tea options as well, which I found inviting, especially mint tea, which is rare to see at coworking spaces. I was told hospitality is priority here and I surely saw it manifest in how I was treated, as well as what was in the fridge and the kitchen. One other thing: THEY OFFER FRUIT WATER!!! My favorite thing 🙂

LIBRARY

They have a library with book shelves and soft white lighting - see images attached here. It’s quiet and very chill. They have couches and chairs with tables. So, the design is accommodating for all preferences. I loved the art on walls - it makes the space feel homey!

MEDITATION  🧘🏻‍♀️ ROOM 

They have rooms for focusing, meditation, nursing, and just being quiet. I found it to be very thoughtful. They recognize how much human brain needs recharging and how much nursing moms need privacy. That’s, to me, hospitality in action. 

WORKSHOPS

They offer workshops to their members on the topics of LinkedIn, Google Analytics, and the one coming up in July is about video. 

HAPPY HOUR

They do happy hour between 4:30 and 5:30 pm, which is great! I like that they have the fridge full of goodies for their members and they keep in mind vegan preferences. When I worked out of Prototype Prime, there was nothing for vegans, regardless the requests, and it felt like obvious discrimination. This location clearly recognizes differences in people’s preferences and makes everyone feel included. It’s awesome!

COWORKING VS PRIVATE OFFICE

There are many options for private offices of all sizes and types. There are large and small offices with and without windows. I wouldn’t work without windows because it’s quite dark but the food thing is they have options. They also have call rooms you can reserve. It’s pretty quiet inside office rooms, which is wonderful because when I worked out of Prototype Prime, everyone could hear everyone’s business which is unacceptable, in my opinion. 

BATHROOMS

As you know from my reviews, bathrooms are important to me. The bathrooms here are plenty, they have a full body mirror and mouth wash, as well as hand lotion. They didn’t have air freshener though, and the Kleenex box was empty.

Hope this review helps you decide!

Great environment, fantastic design, intelligently created work spaces, and an involved community that they have generated with all the companies there. Powerful events and seminars are hosted every week there.

We are extremely satisfied with StartHub, and would recommend its office spaces as one of the best in the area! Great Space, Even Better Team!

The hot desk area is a place to work and get concentrated.
I guess that it'll be good to explain people that it they want to have a meeting they can use the meeting rooms, and if they are going to work in group, then rent a private office. Does it makes sense?

No issues with the prior two, in fact very happy (Anthony was great). However, the most recent building management is inflexible, authoritarian in their customer service approach (meaning you ""the customer"" are never right) towards the tenants or ""members"" as wework calls them. After giving wework over $60,000 in rent PLUS forfeiting over $5,000 in deposits for one of my larger office due to business cost-cutting and reorganization, management has decided to increase my last month's rent by over $557 simply because I was late in submitting my request to move out. Being pragmatic, I understand I was late in submitting my request to move out. However, I was expecting a similar pragmatic thinking to be reciprocated. I caution anyone who is a self-starter and entrepreneur that is not backed by Investor capital and is looking for a place that understands the plight of uncertainty of the business owner -- steer clear from the wework Security Building. I was considering a ""hot desk"" at this building but I'd much rather give my money to Brickell City Center or any of their other locations. FYI, after having addressed my issue with other tenants and this is a common experience among at least 5 other similar business owners in the building who are just waiting for their agreements to be up so that they can move to one of the other buildings.",1

Again i recommended for working but i have already sent like 10 tickets to resolve our problem. Sometimes too much technology takes away the common sense of human interaction.,3

Needing 45-60 minutes to set up, this is a problem for a 9am depo. Conference rooms are adequate in size and not too hard to set up in.

Parking can be difficult at the Aksarben Village location, but arriving by 8:20 isn't too bad. Once I had an afternoon job and had to park at the top of the parking structure (which has an elevator) to the southeast and that caused quite a trek with the equipment cart from there to the building with the Regus unit. There is a long stretch (approx. 500') from structure to building without cover, so had it been raining, this would have been very bad! But the parking there is all free.

Downtown Omaha Regus has a slightly better parking option, but it's still always quite a trek thru 2 elevators and over a city block of pushing, but all under cover of inclement weather. And that building forces you to use a freight elevator, even with a small equipment cart, which usually adds 2-3 minutes on getting up to their floor, vs. the standard elevator. They don't validate, so parking costs.

I've never worked at the west Omaha Regus location. But from what I hear, parking may be a little better.",4

Almost no one talked to each other or really barely acknowledged each other. The group salad meals on Friday were the one exception to this. But, in general, I'm amazed how few people I actually interacted with. It took me leaving the bay and finding amazing socially-nourishing coworking spaces in Berlin and Oaxaca, MX to realize just how bad the impact hub oakland was [for me].

The space is nice and really, many of the staff were nice and did their best. But there's something just really off in the vibe at this coworking space. I think it could be because it tries to mix social justice goals with coworking goals (it's really unclear if it is a coworking space, a social justice project, or a business accelerator...)...It could be because Oakland is changing/gentrifying/displacing so much and this tension is felt acutely here. It could be because the new bay area startup people are kind of lame. Could be because everyone is working too much/hard in the bay. Could be the impact hub doesn't have enough events. And also could be that I look for a totally different thing in a coworking space than most.

For the record, I also tried the port to no avail.

I think the biggest thing that disappointed me is just how far this place felt from its potential. When I first got to Oakland and this space, I was imagining the chance to connect with all these different sorts of people and for people to be collaborating and helping eachother with their projects/work. To have a place just down broadway that I would feel welcome to work out of. And to hit all sorts of unique/mind-expanding events.

I ended up opting for coffeeshops instead. I actually felt less lonely working at Arbor, Lucky Duck, Farley's east vs. paying to feel even lonelier at the impact hub.",2

We started our business here, and we enjoyed the vibe in the kitchen -- everyone loves to say hi to each other, we exchange ideas, we supported each other, we learned from each other, and cheer for each other, and we fortunately saw many business grow overtime.

First off, the view onto the Bay from the 7th floor is just absolutely stunning and the common area space, with its multiple nooks, is inviting (you can tell that a lot of effort was placed on the interior design model). It’s not all about the views and delicious ‘spa water’ infused with different fresh fruit daily that makes this a fantastic place to work in. In fact, it’s the people who work here (specifically Katy, Lacy, Smita, and Ellie) that make sure to make you feel like you’re a part of the community.  I look forward to more community events (that are apparently in the works) to meet the WeWork Community here in emeryville! I really don’t have any complaints that come to mind other than sometimes the air conditioning is on too high in our offices and the main door to the women's bathroom on the 7th floor needs to be fixed (the door doesn’t lock) — hopefully I didn’t just put any women at risk while using the bathroom.",5

Thursday happy hours, do-it-yourself activities, and other events give us all a chance to get to know each other--even the naturally-standoffish will find something to enjoy.

I've talked to both women and men who identify as feminists who resent the idea and all I can say is try it.

The location is great and the team works hard at developing community.   Those are the pluses.  However, there are a couple fairly big negatives, such that I would think twice -especially if you are looking at their fourth floor suites.  The biggest issues  is their in ability to  regulate a comfortable or consistent temperature.  It is usually far too cold, (was occasionally as low as the 50's this past winter) and occasionally too hot.   We have alternated between having to (more often) run multiple heaters to keep it warm enough, to (less often) having to open the suite door to get a breeze.  Either one is distracting to deal with and simply un-professional.     We have constantly been reaching out to management, and have a had a variety of responses over the months from ""it's a pre-war building"", to ""we're working on it"" to the most recent which  is that 68 degrees is within their range of acceptability.

I'm giving this three stars for a lot of reasons. I should put it out there that my membership was somewhat non-conventional. I needed a place to do some disciplined studying 24/7 for 3 weeks. I got a 20% off promo, which was $160 and lasted 3 weeks. Beer on tap, free coffee, printing. That is somewhat worth the 8 dollars per day. But it's still overpriced. I realized how overcharged I was when I went to quit and they offered me a month-long membership for $90 dollars to stick around. That's less than half the rate I was being charged EVEN WITH A PROMO. It was great to have a dedicated spot to go work whenever I felt like it, but it started to kill my creativity. The environment seemed sort of superficial and the Bro ratio was a little high for my liking, they literally played the same 20 songs on loop 24/7. If you're a freelancer looking for somewhere to work and build community and you don't mind these things or being overcharged, go for it. That being said, and I mean this in the best of ways to the employees and WeWorkers of Capella Tower: if you want to feel more a part of the rest of society/ the working world, go to a coffee shop or a locally owned co-working space around Minneapolis. The  concept of shared working spaces is by no means new, WeWork just made it really expensive and stuck on some added luxuries to make you feel special.",3

They  sell gear, snacks and swag at a reasonable price. The bathrooms are great and have showers and lockers (they also sell locks for cheap). Really friendly staff! 

Bouldering wise, my favorite thing about this gym is that the routes are immaculate. The lighting is great and the holds are super readable. This is something that is kind of subtle but if you get used to this you will be spoiled for climbing gyms forever.

The style of setting is more focused on problem solving than power and grip strength. There are slabs are like 100 degrees. Slabs at other gyms are probably like 80 or 70 degrees. It's probably less likely to emulate routes in the wild but I don't think that's the goal in the first place.

The only gripe I could hear about these Bouldering projects is that the route setting and circuit system is definitely catered toward beginners. That's fine for me because I am not very good at climbing haha. If you want to try out Bouldering or are looking for a home gym, this is probably it.",5

Choosing Anahata was one of the best decisions we made throughout the planning process, and we couldn't have been happier with our experience!

We found Anahata online in December 2017. From the start, Lara – the owner and founder – was so welcoming, responsive, organized, and flexible with us as we planned our entire wedding from out-of-state, save for a few trips to meet her and scope out the venue. The moment we walked in we knew it was the right place for us. The unique feel and flexibility of the space was the perfect canvas on which we could paint our vision of an intimate, warm, evening winter wedding – both ceremony and reception. Lara and Lauren – Anahata’s wedding coordinator with whom we consulted, who was also amazing – graciously accommodated helped us refine our ideas for how to decorate, set up for, and transition between the ceremony and reception. 

We'd been to weddings and visited venues that felt cavernous, where the energy dissipates. Instead we wanted the feeling of being gathered around a cozy hearth for the ceremony, then involving as many guests as possible for the dancing in the reception. We achieved this easily! 

We did our rehearsal the night before the wedding, and did all our own set up the day of – rented furniture, floral displays, and other decorations. Throughout the night, we used the loft room as a quiet place for the bride and other guests, had the bar in the side room underneath the loft, sound and music station in the corner outside the bar, and desserts and appetizers in the kitchenette area. 

All this considered, our 120+ guests (180 invitees) fit completely comfortably during the ceremony, with half sitting and half standing, and tall tables lining the back wall. For the reception we cleared the center of the room for dancing and set up a lounge area to one side. Our guests fit comfortably in this configuration too. We had coat racks in the hallway outside the room and stored excess furniture in the stairwell. We did not serve dinner, though we probably could have done a buffet along the back wall if we’d had fewer than 100 guests. We hired the preferred caterer for the bar and appetizers, which worked without a hitch.

The whole thing couldn’t have gone more perfectly! And the fact that we can say that as the first wedding at Anahata speaks to Lara’s magic and the magic of the space. We’re so, so grateful we chose Anahata, and hope you choose it for your wedding or event as well!",5

The lobby is staffed and around the corner is a super breakfast and lunch place. The bank of elevators never leave you waiting long.

Services. Reception off of the elevator bank, high speed internet, phone service and reception. Copies, fax, notary, mail, delivery services, and you get the idea - full service.

Staff. This is where Metro Offices really shines. The staff is highly efficient, processes requests to an exacting standard, and highly professional in every way.

First day here the staff doesn't tend to show you around on anything; printer, meeting rooms, trash area. You're left in the dust after you sign your lease agreement. They sold us on the copy/printing, and I had to ask how to connect to printer, and the staff member, Ashley sent me over directions on how to connect the driver. After I told her it didn't work, she sent me the phone number for their printer company to talk to.. So after being on the phone with the printer company for over an hour, they realized it wasn't my computer, it was that Regus put a restricted code that isn't allowing new users. I told Ashley, she contacted their IT, and I have to consistently ask for updates as she doesn't know how to follow-up well. She said it's 72 hours until she gets a response from their IT... 

In our lease we were told that there was a free small conference room, and that room is non-existent.  She said it was a first come first serve room that needed to be book the day of the meeting, when that day came I asked her how to book and she said they sold the ""conference room"" space and there isn't a free one anymore to be provided.

CAVEAT EMPTOR! RUN!!! Staff is brand new.... And do not tend to your needs nor care once you're in the lease.

Chris was our leasing agent, and he is no where responsive or no where to be found once the ink was dry and we signed our lease. I saw him once in the office and didn't bother to look at me after I reached out to him on e-mail for a question..

When we pointed it out to our server she said they couldn’t give us a substitution, so half of the already few finger sandwiches went uneaten. Our kids were pretty disappointed and left hungry.

My contract states an End date of June 30th 2019, But they are claiming I only had till March 30th to make changes and forcing me to an undisclosed increase amount till June 2020. 

I have tried to speak with Ann at this location who has still yet to return my calls for 2 days now or provide me copies of my contract, that I requested. She uses email to refer me to the ""account help desk"" who refers me back to local office. 

Luckily I found my contract and there are some MAJOR discrepancies that NO ONE wants to acknowledge. 

** Per the terms under 2.3 CANCELLATION: EITHER THE PROVIDER OR THE CLIENT CAN TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AT THE END DATE STATED IN IT, ""OR"" AT THE END OF ANY EXTENSION OR RENEWAL PERIOD, BY GIVING AT LEAST THREE MONTHS WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE OTHER. 

1) they are using the word ""OR"" which means that there is a choice and my End date clearly states ""June 30th, 2019""

2) It Also states I must give at least 3 months notice, which would from my interpretation, make me responsible to extend the current contract 90 days from today, since I did so before end date on contract.

3) Per Florida Statue 501.165 Automatic renewal of service contracts: 2b: Any seller that sells, leases, or offers to sell or lease any service to a consumer pursuant to a service contract that has an automatic renewal provision, unless the consumer cancels that contract, shall disclose the automatic renewal provision clearly and conspicuously in the contract....

4) It clearly states: ""CAN TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AT THE END DATE STATED IN IT"" which says June 30th, 2019

5) Per Florida Statue 501.165 Automatic renewal of service contracts: ""Notification shall be provided to the consumer no less than 30 days or no more than 60 days before the cancellation deadline pursuant to the automatic renewal provision.  

6) Per your records, you are claiming a notice was sent via an electronic notification on March 10th, 2019. Based on that email you ONLY provided a maximum of 20 days, which is a violation of Florida state law.

The office manager and even the general manager were soso nonresponsive that they were never able to correct the issue and, instead, of trying to resolve the situation, they just informed us that they don’t loose mail. 

I had so many clients that had to reissue payments that I am now renting a new office but still have 90 days remaining in my contract with Regus.  The GM said she would  allow us to cancel early but that was 60 days ago and they’re still billing us.  Calls and emails to the office as well as corporate resulted in zero action.  We were told that it could be canceled early but no one ever returns calls or emails.

I should have known this was going to be s problem during the antiquated, paper-based sign-up process that took almost 3 weeks to finish after we finally heard back from a salesperson just to get a quote.  You can’t find pricing online or register online.  Everything was done by mail and tools weeks.

I called this location and explained what I needed.  They told me they could accommodate that request. 

When I arrived at the location, one of the two front desk attendants told me that I would need to set up an account and have a profile created with them.  I inquired as to why this would be necessary.  After all, Regus is supposed to be all about client convenience.  I should be able to show up, give them my credit card to pay for the day office and then get to work.  The process should be quick and easy.  This first attendant handed me off to another front desk attendant.  

The second attendant named Carolyn insisted that I have to have an account and profile set up in their system.  I gave her my business card so she could take down the information.  I then said that I did not want to receive any emails or solicitations from them and that if they couldn't agree to that to please list a fake email address on the profile.  The second attendant had no interest in responding to my point about solicitations.  She didn't tell me whether or not they would spam me, whether or not I could opt out of emails, etc.  Instead, she said, ""Do you want to rent the office or not?"".  At that point, I told her I was no longer interested.  

Carolyn then made a comment to the effect that they had a lot of bookings today and that she had done me a favor by trying to find space for me and accommodate me.  The entire time, this Carolyn person kept making comments like, ""I'm sorry we can't help you"" and ""You have a great day"" in the most snide, passive aggressive manner possible. 

At this point, I very calmly told this Carolyn person that I found her so discourteous.  The other front desk attendant said, ""Yeah, well, that's how I felt about you when you first walked in here.""  

Impressions:  Amateurish, unprofessional, discourteous, not accommodating, bad front desk staff.  For a provider of day offices, they are terrible.  For a provider of executive office space, I would never want to deal with the type of people that they have staffing this front desk and the location is relatively poor (near the airport, not downtown in a business district).",1

If this is how they do business -- it is no wonder that they have trouble leasing spots in their building. Called and spoke with the leasing office about a package that was delivered to the wrong address. The number in Google, was the only number that I had to call to start my investigative process. If I had dialed the wrong number, would it have killed the guy to politely give me the correct number to call? I called the first time and had our old suite number, I was told no one occupied this space. I called back with a different suite number to check to see who occupied the space.  This time I was intentionally hung up on twice, sent to voice mail once, and then finally the same gentleman asked ""HELLO?!"" no ""Bennett Davis, this _______how can I help you.?"" Get real. I explained to him that I had just spoken to him and I had a new suite number. This time I was told he didn't know what I was talking about... ""this is the leasing office""... yes... it is .... so shouldn't you have information on who leases specific suite numbers???
