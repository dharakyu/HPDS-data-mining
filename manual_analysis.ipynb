      "Very cool space and great place to get on your laptop finish up some work. Lots of hipsters. Like a LOT. You've been warned. Coffee was ok.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "THIS PLACE. First, the waffles - slightly crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Combine that with a wide assortment of their toppings and you're golden. Go for extra decadence with their drinks - boyfriend ordered their tiff macchiato (comes with 1\\/4 churro waffle!) and I ordered their tuxedo frappe, both of which were fantastic, if a little on the richer side. We are visiting Vegas only for a few days and so far we just haven't been able to have something other than Tiabi for breakfast. Kudos to the guy behind the counter, who was really friendly and made sure we enjoyed our stay!\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "I hate bashing small mom and pop places but this place isn't good at all. Had the panini which was extremely dry had another dish and was dry as well. I also had the chicken pot pie which was salty and the worst part had a piece of hair in it. That really killed my appetite. Threw in the towel and asked for the check and left very disappointed!! Won't be back that's for sure.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "This is the only place we do coffee in Madison anymore. Great drinks. Serious apple cider. The best part is the staff, though. Everyone is super nice and personable. You feel like a regular on your first visit. Local art on the walls is always a plus too.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Best library in town!!! So helpful & nice!\n",
      "Great selection & customer service is the best!\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Came here for iced tea. Why is it so difficult to find iced tea? Anyways, I asked specifically if they can make an iced tea, was told yes. So after telling them the two teas and sizes I needed, they brewed them in their appropriate hot cups and then handed them to me. I asked if there was ice for them \"ohh yes!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So she pulls out this tiny little plastic cup, maybe MAYBE half the size of what the hot cup was and said \"this is all we have for iced tea\" it was literally a sip. So it being all hot and steamy i just said fine, and watched as she poured all of the tea down the sink to put just a little in these tiny cups. \n",

      "When I was growing up, my mom always took us to the library and I would check out stacks of books at a time.  From the Bobbsey twins, to Nancy Drew, to Agatha Christie, I remember going to the library over the years and loving it and all the things I could get for free just by having a library card.  Even today as an adult, I dislike buying books because I still have it ingrained in me that I can check them out at the library.  The Summerlin Library has been my neighborhood library since we moved to the area.  It's always quiet and never has a crowd of people when I go.  I'm a huge fan of the study rooms for when I need to concentrate and get school work done.  Thanks to the online catalog (http:\\/\\/ilsweb.lvccld.org\\/search~S12\\/), patrons can also search the database and look for books, CDs, and DVDs for coveted titles and reserve them if they're available.  My son has grown up in this library and I appreciate the fact that, even with the advent of the Internet and e-readers, libraries such as this one still exist.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Krave Coffee has fast became my favorite little indie coffee shop in the neighborhood. Krave Coffee, how much do I adore thee, let me count the ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. You serve kick-ass coffee from known, quality roasters such as Rufino, Sam James and Propeller. \n",
      "2. You have great sitting area, especially the communal \"office\" space.\n",
      "3. You have consistent internet.\n",
      "4. You have an amazing ambiance, with cool grooves playing.\n",
      "5. Last, and most importantly, your entire staff (from management to all the baristas) are awesome!\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "This is my go-to library, because it's closest to home. There always seems to be a decent selection of the new releases, and I can always get in and out quickly. PLUS, I can always go grab a slice of pie next door at Hubbard!\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Great lattes and frappes. Good waffles. Prices are reasonable and they have vegan options. Waffle sandwich was good and so was the red velvet frappe.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "This place looks homie, and is meant to be that way, so expecting a bistro is laughable. There is a tiny waiting area, so if you come here at peak time, there may not be space to wait inside, just like most restaurants I know, so no one should ever complain about that. Service is good, considering I'm not at nor paying for a dine-in restaurant, I'm happy with the service.\n",
      "Alright, on with the food. I ordered the Smoked Salmon Egg Bennie. The presentation was perfect. Generous amount of smoked salmon, sauce, and perfectly cooked eggs. The home fries were good, but could be a little less mushy. I asked for soft egg, and it was poached to perfection. The only complain I have was the sauce. Yes, there were plenty of it, but it was bland. Good thing the smoked salmon has enough flavour to almost saved it.\n",
      "With tips (no drink) my bill came under $15, so it's interesting that some reviewers claim theirs cost $20. Oh well, always read reviews with a critical mind or you will miss out on good food and service.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "I came here full of excitement. It was my first date with Vittoria and I thought it would have been the start of a long beautiful relationship. Having been to the sibling, La Favorita and sampled their 5* proper Italian and GF pizza, I had been told Vittoria's did the same pizza's. I had consumed minimal amounts of food so I could do Vittoria's justice. It was to be the highlight of my day and a reward after six hours of interview transcription. Oh dear. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not the smartest idea I've had. No lovely La Favorita, thin and crispy bases but a.n.other generic GF base (small GF size too). Ok, so I was disappointed but hey, it could have still been good, but no. The pizza itself was served at best lukewarm (I suspected cooked from frozen and not cooked properly) and very quickly was cold and I was regretting not getting pasta. Once I admitted to my friend how disappointed I was, she fessed up to a strange tasting Carbonara so I would have lucked out with the pasta too. Once the spaghetti had been consumed, we saw the scrambled egg at the bottom of the plate as the egg had been added to the pasta and then over cooked - ick :-(\n",
      "\n",
      "I did have a Vittoria card so we weren't paying full price. We did highlight the issues with our meal (we weren't requesting a replacement as we wanted to escape) and credit to the staff (who were lovely so no complaints about the service) we were offered limoncello or free coffee's but we had already decided to make our escape. Had it been a real date, this would have been an escape out of the bathroom window time...\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to admit, I can't remember the last time I had such a bad meal and as you'll see from my reviews, I'm pretty good at giving credit with the stars. I was wishing we had travelled further to go to La Favorita (part of the same group) but I can't imagine that I'll be returning to Vittoria anytime soon which I'm sad about, especially as so many work colleagues had raved about it :-(\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "The setup of the cafe is nice, there's large tables for big groups to comfortably sit at, complete with a deck of playing cards to entertain you until your food is ready. There's lots of chalk writing on the walls with a bunch of UNLV references and other scrabble, which gives it a local and laid-back feel. It was kinda cool but the colors get obnoxious if you stare at them for too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty impressed with the waffles here. I ordered a sugary cinnamon one, and my boyfriend had one of their waffle sandwiches. I think the only thing slightly disappointing was the coffee. I got a pumpkin spice drink, and the espresso\\/coffee they made it with tasted burnt and old.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd probably return here, but not for the coffee.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "This was my favorite coffee place for the last couple years.  Unfortunately it was bought out a couple months ago and the new owner is a joke.  He keeps jacking up the prices.  He got rid of the punch cards for a new system, and now he won't accept a $10 gift card I have with no expiration date.  I hate people who write bad reviews on places, but I felt the need on this one.  This guy is ruining my favorite coffee place\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Awesome local coffee shop that roasts its own beans. Great atmosphere with patio overlooking a lake. Tucked in behind the Chipotle. One of 2 coffee shops worth coming to in Scottsdale!\n",

      " La nouvelle maison-bibliothèque de Sol est tout humblement esstradinaire! Visitez-là! Habitez-là! :) Wohaa! On y retrouve toutes sortes d'espaces pour les travaillants et des aires de jeu pour les tous petits. En prime, c'est une bible-boulathèque où l'on peut faire du brruit! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "La bibliothèque n'est ouverte que depuis quelque jours et je m'y sens déjà chez moi. L'architecture spectaculaire et généralement austère de Dan S. Hanganu s'est cette fois-ci très bien adaptée à la personnalité de Sol, et offre un décor sophistiqué comportant toutes sortes de recoins à parcourir, des salles tantôt vastes tantôt intimes, et de l'espace à ravir pour les enfants, qui semblent se vouloir être les vedettes de ces lieux. C'est une bibliothèque où l'on a le droit, semble-t-il, de \" faire du bruit \", à la différence des autres bibliothèques. \n",
      "\n",
      "Étant une bibliothèque de quartier, elle dispose d'une collection tout de même appréciable si on la compare aux autres bibliothèques du réseau. Elle comporte beaucoup d'espaces de travail pour les adultes et quasiment tous les postes on des prises de courant pour les appareils. Il y a une connexion Internet du réseau gratuit \" Île sans fil \", qui fonctionne très bien même quand la bibliothèque est pleine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Il y a plusieurs salles de jeu, des salles de réunion, des salles multimédias, on peut louer des CD de musique, des films, des jeux vidéo, en plus de la collection habituelle de livre. Le réseau de prêt inter-bibliothèque de la ville de Montréal est également disponible aux usagers disposant d'une carte de bibliothèque de la ville. Enfin, la bibliothèque est munie des équipements derniers cris pour le prêt, la recherche et le retour de documents. \n",
      "\n",
      "Elle est située à deux pas de la station de métro Rosemont, et avec un peu de chance on peut se garer dans les rues avoisinantes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Je ne travaille pas pour le réseau des bibliothèques de Montréal, mais je lui donne mon appui à 100% pour ce lancement réussi. C'est vrai que construire de telles installations peut s'avérer onéreux, mais ce sont également ces projets qui, lorsqu'ils sont bien menés, inspirent la prochaine génération d'innovateurs, et dans ce cas-ci de lecteurs. Cette petite bibliothèque fera une très belle compagne à sa grande soeur la BAnQ, à la station Berri-UQAM (Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec).\n",
      "\n",
      "Finalement, l'esprit de la poésie délurée du personnage de Sol, ce gentil mais pauvre sans-abris qui savais mieux que quiconque se défaire des contraintes de la langue afin de mieux défendre, avec sa verve particulière, des idéaux sociaux, me semble bien présent en ces murs. On y entend déjà des enfants jouer, les lignes zigzagantes de l'architecture qui fuient au détour des couloirs et le murmure incessant des usagers travaillant ensemble ou échangeant quelques paroles sur des sujets de la littérature me semblent tous des signes que l'héritage de Marc Favreau s'est finalement trouvé une maison, un havre où il pourra continuer de s'épanouir, au plus grand bénéfice des générations futures.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "What beautiful library... \n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of space and everyone has been courteous.  I like the open fifth floor desks looking south out the window.   Nice exhibits for study breaks, although I wouldn't leave my stuff out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bathrooms and building are well maintained.  Private study rooms are available and quiet.  Hours are a little short.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a PUBLIC library in the city so expect there to be bums looking for free WiFi to watch cat videos.  I don't mind and everyone minds their business without any bother.  No one has been too loud or abnoxious.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're a suburbanite who thinks the city is a dangerous place and fear your children will get hooked on drugs or join a gang based on coordinates... This library would not be your first choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy!\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "There's a rush of high school students that show up at about 2 when the school across the street lets out. I would recommend not coming at this time or anytime after that. They are very loud and trash the place and sometimes the mess sits for hours after the kids have left. Generally speaking the staff does nothing about it. They have a little sign on the wall that says \"seating for customers only\" but don't enforce it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Outside of that annoying bit, I really like the place. Small and quiet with a great atmosphere. They offer great teas and coffee for a very reasonable price.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "I've always come here for drinks. First time I tried food there was yesterday and had that West Coast Wafflewich. Amazing! Not too heavy for all those flavors and that Tiabi sauce was out of this world! Had a Sirena Tea to go with the wafflewich, very refreshing. A must-return-to-restaurant for sure.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "I've been to a lot of libraries in my life and have never encountered a system such as theirs. The books have no numbers on the spine. What happened to the Dewey decimal system? It's like you're given a subject such as SOCSI or TECH and have to go to that section and fend for yourself. There is no numerical order. I took off another star for being kind of small and a lot of books that I'm looking for they just didn't have, so I'll have to go elsewhere. I took off another star because most of the chairs at the computers just aren't working right. Other than that it's a pretty decent library.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Drove here for the Las Vegas at museum, umm... Still looking! The gift shop was not helpful at all and the volunteers just wanted to visit with their friends. If looking for a real museum go to the strip and avoid the long drive out to this gallery with a few photos on the wall.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Sweet local coffee shop. Loved the hometown feel of this place.  My mocha was amazing. They told me they make all the chocolate and whipped cream there, which I totally believe.  Great place with great customer service.  Going here every day on my vacation.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "This is such a hidden gem!\n",
      "\n",
      "It's amazing that we have this free little museum with the largest contraceptive collection, and so few people know about it!  It was strangely fascinating to walk through and I feel as though with a likely small budget and fairly small space, they did a good job curating.  There are a plenitude of interesting stories and things that any average person would walk away with having not known before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worth checking out!\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "We were lucky to randomly drive by this place after not being able to get in to another local diner for brunch. We were so impressed by the quality of the food here! We all tried something different...my brisket and egg brioche sandwich was incredible. My friend's corn beef hash was perfect. My other friend gave the cook very specific instructions for her scrambled eggs and bacon and both were perfectly cooked to order!  We had such a great experience here...highly recommended!\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Great food, great coffee, great people, great service!\n",
      "\n",
      "I love everything about the CSI Coffee Pub beginning with the fact that it's nestled into the warm and inviting basement of the Centre for Social Innovation's annex location. The staff here are incredibly friendly and they have built this coffee pub from the ground up, turning it from a tiny little espresso stand into a full-fledged operation that now serves the community.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You can feel good when you come here because everything is local and sustainable--from the coffee to the food. Fresh buns and green juice are delivered by bicycle each morning and there are enough pastries and treats to appease most any sweets-seeker. They have no problem adjusting menu items to suit your preferences and they make a mean cortado--even with skim milk. \n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, the space itself is inspiring (search back a few entries because I've reviewed it too!). You really can't go wrong working here in the company of good people and good coffee.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "I travel a lot for work, and everywhere I go, one of the things I search for is a local coffee roaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there it is, sitting right in the front of a warm, cozy, welcoming shop. I had a pour over, which was measured, timed, etc all to the standard I expect of an excellent coffee shop.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What REALLY makes this place stand out, though, is their cold brew.  It was phenomenal, without a doubt, in the top three iced coffees I've ever had anywhere in this country.  Even black, it had a smooth, velvety creaminess, while still being refreshing and thirst quenching.   I have no idea how they do it.  I've had 24 hour brew. I've had Guatemala (where their current beans were from, I guess).  I've had cold brew that uses that same drip grind size. Nothing NOTHING has been as outstanding as what Smelly Cat puts out.  I'm simply blown away, still, a week later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise, cafe space was clean, spacious, cute with mismatching chairs and tables, and a stack of board games. Folks were sitting both inside and out, and (gasp) conversing with each other instead of having their heads stuck in laptops. \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff were beyond friendly, kind, and helpful in suggesting places to check out in the neighborhood.  If I'm ever back in Charlotte, I'll be at this place in a heartbeat to try their cortados, shots, and whatever else they can do.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "How can you not love the library? The smell of books and the notion of diving into a great adventure gets me everytime. This location seems to attract quite a few transient types but I've never had an issue with them confronting me or making me feel uncomfortable. Every so often the people out front looking for you to sign their ballots can be a little annoying but just keep your head down and walk quickly and you'll be fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "This location has a huge selection of dvd's\\/cd's\\/magazines\\/specialty books (i.e. larger font). This location also has a business center, teen center, children's area and rare book collection. The beautiful views of Phoenix to the north and south are an added bonus. I really like the clear staircase in the middle of the building, the clear elevators and the water feature. The restrooms have always been super clean as well. I love coming here and wandering around for a few hours especially on a rainy day.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Great spot to people watch but honestyl the ice coffee was amazing.. nicely roasted and the bean already had a hint of sweetness that I didnt even need sugar, Just a little creamy. I also got the smoke salmon bagel and that was really good too and just gave me a great start to my morning.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "They actually have a decent selection of books, cds and dvds for being so quaint and one of the smaller branches. I've never had an issue with parking when I've gone however they always seems to be a ton here. Librarians are friendly and it's nice to deal with one of them instead of just going to a computer like everything else these days. Since my printer is on the fritz, I go here to make copies since it's only $.20 a page which saves me a ton of money instead of going to FedEx. It's super easy to reserve a computer if you need to get some work done and best of all-free with your card! A+ for people watching!\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Pvp zone is great and hunter is awesome! This is my second time here and i will definitely come back again. They have razer keyboards and logitech mice for every comp :)\n",

      "Super cute coffee house. The reviews don't lie-the dirty chai is perfect. Coffee bean burlap bags cover the ceiling under exposed beams, while the walls are lined with \"booths\" made with recycled wooden doors. The drink menu is small, but covers the essentials. The atmosphere was quiet (Friday late morning) with people studying intently and Bob Marley playing intermittently between bouts of silence. I was disappointed with the food selection. The items are pre-made, wrapped in foil and kept in a glass case display warmer, reminding me of late night drunken 7-11 visits in my early 20s. There were maybe 3 different types of pastries in a similar (empty) case. I had the southwest burrito which was lukewarm, but tasted good and did the job, but I won't order it again. I will, however come back for that dirty chai!\n",

      "Street Coffee has been bookmarked for a while now and I was finally able to make my way downtown to try it out. Street Coffee, I wonder how they got their name ... maybe because they're on a main street? (Apologies for my poor attempt of understanding of how the cafe's name came to be.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The cafe is literally located in a home, with beautiful neutral interior that simple and with a good amount of seating. WiFi is decently fast and free. Also, if you're into natural light this place has windows in every wall so you can get bright light without having to suffer from the AZ heat because of the AC. Since the place has high ceilings, conversations of nearby folk may sound almost booming- something to keep in mind, especially if you are looking for a really quiet place to lounge at or get work done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Didn't get a chance to see what was popular here, so I asked the person working the cashier who mentioned that there were three drinks on the menu that were. I ended up going with the The Garfield, a white mocha\\/mint\\/honey latte, as it marked a resemblance to Philz' Mint Mojito back in California. A tried and true favorite of mine! I mentioned that I wanted it to be a little less sweet, as I am not too keen on highly sugary coffee drinks. The drink was made quickly and brought out to my table. Good buzz of caffeine, not too sweet ... however it was lacking the Mint factor I was looking forward to. I, in fact, didn't taste any mint and I have an inkling that they probably use a Mint syrup which would make sense. Not a lot of Mint syrup = not too sweet and not a lot of Mint flavor. Other than the lack of flavoring, the latte was solid. Milky, creamy, slightly sweetened and with a good buzz.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also sell pastries and non-coffee beverages, so I would say it is kid-friendly and of course for those not a fan of stimulants. Haha!\n",
      "\n",
      "Price point is decent, it's aesthetic, mostly quiet the time I was there and they have their own parking lot located out back. All things I really appreciate. Holding out on that last half star or star for next time when I'll try out their other drinks to confirm the stellar reviews marked here.\n",

      "River Dog\n",
      "\n",
      "At a glance it looks like a cool new hip hot dog joint just popped up in Rocky River. Dogs with great toppings. But don't be fooled. At a location that is wanting of something great and different, River Dog falls short on flavor, technique and style.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Let me start with the easy part. French Fries! Every cooking show on the food network  shows you how to make them. Food trucks and county fairs can master the art of crunchy and salty. However, River Dog makes little soft tasteless pillows. They boast of organic angus. While im sure an organic fed angus hotdog might find a way to be good, with proper toppings. Im not sure its worth the time or the price tag. Give me a snappy, properly grilled or deep fried hot dog and all its fat. It's the flavor and snap that im after. Ok, now thats resolved. Let us move on to the bun. Too much bun and kinda gummy. I think they use an orlando sandwich bun. The proper dog should be delivered on a light bun. slightly soft and specific to hot dogs. The delivery should never be overwhelming like a bus or a truck, but rather a beach comber slowly and gently dropping you off at the local bar. \n",
      "\n",
      " I thought the topping lacked in flavor. My wife's dog was topped with rubbery bacon. I got a chili style dog. I believe that the chili was made by an Irish women that refused to use salt, pepper or any other ingredient related flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Seems they wanted to decorate the place. Well that didnt work out so well either. I think the \"All Over the Place\" movement was what they wr going for. They nailed it, and to the wall. Next to a small framed Yoda, sits three italian cook books surrounded by candle stick holders and a random mid 70's action figure. Every little grouping of decorations suggests \"4 family garage sale\" this Saturday!!! in Parma!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Im giving them time to grow into the new space. But in the meantime, they should take a day off and head to Scooter Dogs in Mentor. The decor is cool, but you only notice it while you wait in line, not while you eat.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Is this place secretly a Starbucks in disguise? Or did a Starbucks used to occupy the space? I'm not sure but the drive-thru screamed Starbucks - the menu board, the electronic ordering box, the order window... The barista at the window was wearing a green apron and the straws are green. Even the logo on the cups are green! I thought about all of this as I ordered and sat waiting in my car for my drink. The wait wasn't very long but it was boring. No friendly greeting or social chit-chat. Just an impersonal exchange of money and latte. I ordered a small, hot, vanilla latte and it was nothing special. It actually tasted a little watered down. My husband had a few sips and said it was okay. Overall, I don't think I'll be back. There are several more local coffee shops in the area and they are much better than this. Don't waste your time on mediocre!\n",

      "The Leith Library is situated in a beautiful classic building, built around 1929. I went there to get a Web Hosting reference book which I found in the Science & Technology section, obviously.  The borrowing and return process can be done at their automated kiosks, and is a pretty straight forward process. I'll advise you to get a printed ticket for your records every time a book is returned, just in case. Its interior is luminous and spacious. They claim that they have WiFi, but somehow I could not connect using my Library number and password, no matter how hard I try, several times on different days, no luck. The book and media collections are adequate considering that it isn't a big building, but it helps a lot. Books' availability for borrowing can be checked on-line (Your Library website) which is pretty useful as they can exactly tell you where and how many copies are available by scanning all Edinburgh Libraries.  The Leith Library is a good culture starting place for Leith residents as they offer Book Groups, MSP's surgeries, IT beginners' computer classes, room hire, etc. The building, IT system and media collection might be in need of some extra investment through the Edinburgh Council, though.\n",

      "I was in the area for free peach ice cream at the regional farmer's market when I noticed the Billy Graham Library was nearby. I'm not exceptionally religious and I don't attend church anymore, but my entire family is extremely involved in their personal relationships with Jesus, so I figured I'd go in and get them some merch. Plus it's rated as a top destination in Charlotte.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entrance was easy. Lots of trees for shade, which provided for a peaceful vibe. The parking lot is huge -- and quite packed -- and is directly next to Billy Graham's rebuilt childhood home and the library building, which has a large glass cross built into it. The idea is that we enter through the foot of the cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lovely older lady opened the door to the library, asked if it was my first visit, and told me to go to Information to get a pamphlet about the \"Journey of Faith\" tour. The woman who greeted me at the Information Desk was so sweet that I couldn't get myself to say, \"I actually just came in for a magnet\" and soon I was standing in front of a talking\\/singing cow waiting for the introductory presentation to begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour and a half later, I had made my way through several videos documenting Billy Graham's life and that of his family members, a ton of artifacts, a room dedicated to his late wife, and even some international displays. The final room is aptly a salvation theater, where folks can hear the gospel message. Prior to walking in, cards are provided to say if you accepted Jesus into your heart or nah, and you can speak with a guest counselor after if you'd like to pray or learn more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I grew up in the church and under the influence of Graham's teachings. That provided a good base to understand his ministry. I'm not sure how the museum would feel without a similar background. I know they're welcoming to anyone and everyone, and the people working throughout seriously could not have been nicer, but I'm sure it's a different experience. I'd say if you want to learn about Christianity and Graham, this is a nice, nonjudgmental place to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there are things about and ideologies of Billy Graham that I personally do not like. He certainly hasn't been free from controversy over the years, and his family's outward, ongoing support of Donald Trump -- a horrible, disgusting man who degrades women, the disabled, and attacks the press whenever he can -- is truly mind-boggling to me. Just seeing Trump's face inside on the Presidents wall made me audibly cringe. I really do not like that man, and I don't see how he's any sort of testament to Christian teachings.\n",
      "\n",
      "But of course, I don't agree with all of Graham's own beliefs about women either. Like the so-called \"Billy Graham rule\" -- his practice of not spending alone time with women other than his wife before she passed away in 2007. I think that's outdated, absurd, and unrealistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I'd say going into the museum with an open mind is key, no matter your personal beliefs. Billy Graham, 98, is and has been a huge evangelist figure since 1949 in the States and across the globe. It is possible to view the museum primarily from a historical and cultural standpoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the actual exhibits and videos, there's also a huge gift shop with loads of books. I picked out one for my mom about prodigal children, of who I technically am, so I know she'll love it. I also snagged some affordable home decor items for family members, and a couple bookmarks. I actually never even bought a magnet.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the bookstore, it's also possible to stop and eat in their on-site cafeteria. I opted to since I was hungry and it was right there\\/cheap. A combo chicken salad croissant, potato salad, and large coke only set me back $9.15. Nice!\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to his home and the library building, there's also a small memorial garden where Graham's wife is buried. It's quite serene.\n",
      "\n",
      "On my way out the door, the same lady I spoke to earlier at Information asked about how I felt, encouraged me to take a visitor survey, and gave me a free etched tote with a prayer book and readings inside, which I will pass along. She said, \"God bless you\" as I left, and I returned the sentiment.\n",

      "I was in 5th grade and was part of the opening ceremony for this location. Despite the transient activity, I think they continue to do a great job to maintain the facility clean.  When my kids were smaller this library was one of the most visited for us because of the stairs, the elevator with the glass windows and the great kid section with the small, kid size bathrooms!  They have a great selection of movies, new recent movies too as well as classics.  Each floor is dedicated to a different section of books and they have a great number of private desks.  The really bad part of this library is the computer reservations, they're always busy.  You can't just walk in and expect to use one, it could take up to 2 hrs.....but as you may understand, it's because of the users.  I think it's great that the services are free for everyone.  I would like to see more security walking around throughout the building, it would make it more secure.  Additionally, on the first floor where the kid section is, it is surrounded by beautiful windows that unfortunately offer a big view of the outside which displays the transients and their not so appropriate behavior.  If you are looking for a really great library with books and additonal research material this is the perfect place.  But, if you're narrow minded and really particular about dive areas then you may be off put by it's public clientele.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Nice architecture. Plenty of space. Free guest Internet. Natural light available. Different places for different study activities from Silent to Collaborative. Lots of computers for students to use but also many desks with power to use your own computer. They have real books too!\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "This is one of the smaller older public libraries I've been to in Toronto. The selection isn't fantastic and there's only limited seating. Which isn't to say I don't like it - In my books, any library is a good library. The staff at this location have always been lovely, there are public computers available as well as many seminars and classes about everything from income tax forms to job searches, and they recently got that fancy RFID check out I love so much. Besides, it's right near my house and I can request items from any other TPL location be delivered to me here. If you find yourself at this library, take a moment to visit the second floor, whether you need to or not - it has all kinda of character, and even a couple of window seats.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Taylor Memorial Library is full of history, while the original library isnt there anyone more then is still a nice library especially since it contain a stain glass window and a fireplace that was part of Massey home that was near Victoria Park and Dentonia Park , which is now Crescent Town  that is home to Massey and Taylor Creek.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this library was original part of Birchcliff School and named Birchcliff library at Birchcliff and Kingston Road before it was permantly moved to it current location at Warden and Kingston due to offer by Fred Taylor as memorial Library to his late wife Florence Taylor who was a Scarborough native.\n",
      "\n",
      "The library has various piece in the library that celebrate this as you will see in some of my photos.\n",

      "Looking for a coffee place other than Starbucks and Dunkin and landed here after doing some Yelping. Its this inconspicuous little shop hidden in a small plaza behind a rundown gas station. Yup, it's pretty hard to find without navigating to it with Google Maps running. Saw the amazing ratings and had to jump right in. The place is cozy with somewhat dim lighting but enough to get work done. There are also tables and couches around so you can sip coffee and chat with a buddy or get working on that assignment of yours. The counter is right smack dab in the middle and the menu on the back wall. Besides your milky specialty drinks, you also got what looks to be some legit home roasted coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ended up getting tempted by the Dirty Thai Tea which is Thai tea with a shot of espresso. I was concerned that it might too sweet and I was right. It was still too sweet even though it was tempered by the espresso shot. I feel you can only take little spurts of it but a whole cup is too much IMO. My sis got the Flynn which surprisingly wasn't too sweet even though it had coconut cream and caramel in it. It had a stronger coffee flavor that I was looking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel that there are some hits and some misses here but overall this place is a great place to relax and grab a legit cup of coffee. It's home-y and relaxed and a great place to wind down away from the modern looking Starbucks around town. It's a bit hard to find but the search is worth it. I will be back to try other drinks or maybe their black coffee as well.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Let me start by saying that a large part of my dissatisfaction with Altitude Coffee Lab is that their website has obviously not been updated in a while. Now I'm not particularly concerned with the quality of a company's website; however, I came to Altitude over my usual haunt (The Coffee Bean) because their website said they were open until 9 pm, and I always find myself rushing to wrap up whatever assignment I'm working on when The Coffee Bean closes at 8 pm. Welp, it turns out that Altitude actually closes at 6 pm. Had I known this, I would not have gone there to study. Also, there were menu items listed on the website that were no longer on the menu, which was disappointing.\n",
      "Continuing on, the iced mocha I ordered was actually pretty tasty. Drink-wise, I have no complaints. However, the $8 caprese salad I ordered came with three tomato slices...but only two slices of mozzarella. Maybe I'm overreacting, but I thought the point of a caprese salad was to have a taste of tomato and mozzarella in every bite. If I wanted to eat a tomato slice drizzled in balsamic vinegar, I would have done so at home. That extra tomato slice did not give the illusion that it was worth $8, why not just pony up the third slice of mozzarella?\n",
      "As for the atmosphere, Altitude definitely has the whole \"independent coffee shop\" vibe nailed. There are a lot of little tables for people who need to get some work done as well as one very large table for study groups. The patio outside is GORGEOUS, I will admit, and the owner obviously invested in nice patio furniture. There was also a lot of bad art hanging on the walls, an important coffee house staple that people, for one reason or another, seem to go absolutely nuts for. My one big complaint with the atmosphere is that it's pretty dimly lit inside. I can't really hold this against the place though, because there is nothing innately wrong with dim-lighting-it's just not practical for studying. \n",
      "What I can hold against this place, though, is the super snobby barista behind the counter. Look, I realize that you'd rather be doing other things, but those other things probably aren't paying your bills, and that's why you're here working, Mr. Too-Cool-For-School. It's not like the place was busy or anything, yet this guy seemed bothered to answer my questions. It's not like I asked a ton of them either; maybe like, three. This was especially troublesome considering he was A LOT nicer to the more attractive women. I expect that type of nonsense at bars in Old Town, but not in a coffee shop.\n",
      " On the other hand, there was another gentleman there, I'm guessing he was a manager of some sort, who was on his Customer Service A-Game. He had a smile on the entire time and went out of his way to be accommodating, not just with me, but with every single customer. Honestly, had this charming chap not been present, I absolutely would have given Altitude a 2-star rating without hesitation.\n",
      "Also, they have wine and beer available, so that's a plus in my book.\n",

      "I am a student at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science, and I went here with a friend of mine who grew up in Champaign. He couldn't believe the changes. It's a beautiful building with plenty of space and friendly staff. We were able to easily reserve a room so that we could do his fantasy football draft. All of the natural light and comfortable chairs really create a space that is extremely inviting. I'm required to volunteer somewhere for a class of mine, and I chose this library if only to spend more time here. Now if only I could get a library card! I just have to prove I live here...hm...\n",

      "I could not be more impressed with this venue and the staff. We recently held my boyfriend's 40th birthday party which included an open cocktail hour and a Friar's Club-type roast in the adjoining theatre.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  We first walked the space in February with Evelyn. She was extremely professional and assured us if we could dream it, they could do it. I have worked with quite a few event managers and have heard this many times so I erred on the side of dubious at first. During the entire planning process, she was never once out of touch and responded to any and all communication quickly. She was just there. Any questions, concerns she had the answer and if she didn't, she got it quickly. Leading up to the event, we had a few more walk throughs and she was there for us for each one and never seemed bothered or inconvenienced by us needing entry. She seemed as excited for this event as we were. She was fun, funny and the picture of professional. I just cannot say enough about how amazing she is! \n",
      "\n",
      "  Smash cut to the day of the event and not one thing was missed. Nick on sound and lights was ready to go and didn't miss one cue. Even when, we added a video to the end he didn't bat an eye and everything ran perfectly. Connie, Will and the other female bartender (I'm so sorry, I didn't get your name!) were fantastic behind the bar. Even the security team we had at the door was friendly to our guests and didn't come off rude like so many do. During the event Evelyn was right there for us. Whenever we had a concern, she was on it. Any questions were answered quickly and even during the roast she was in the bar waiting for us with any questions or concerns we had. I could not believe how present she was the entire time. \n",
      "\n",
      "  After the event, we went upstairs to the roof and the staff there was just as awesome. There was a change in plans since we ran over and the last portion of our open bar was upstairs. Not a blip in communication and it ran just as smoothly up there, too! We had our reserved area ready for us and promptly danced the rest of the evening away! \n",
      "\n",
      "  There is no possible way to thank the team at Inspire for making this event a success. The venue was perfect for the show and the team takes great pride in how they represent Inspire. If you have a small production or party to plan, this is the place!\n",

      "When I go to a coffee shop, my minimum expectation is that the coffee will be good. I ordered a Peruvian and was expecting the light citrus flavor with a nutty undertone of a freshly roasted bean. I got a burnt cigarette flavor of improperly cleaned coffee maker.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "This place is awesome!  Getting here is easy as pie as it is directly connected to Berri-UQAM metro.  Once you arrive you'll quickly see that it is massive.  There are tons of books on all kinds of subjects and they have both English and French books.  Seating is aplenty so if you come here to work you shouldn't have trouble finding a spot.  I also think they did a great job with the interior design.  It has a very modern look to it and there are big windows looking out onto the street which allows for lots of natural light. \n",

      "If you are a Montreal resident membership is free.  There are a multitude of documents that you can use to prove this so check their website out.  The most handy one is your driver's license.

I'm not sure what the cost is for someone not from here.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Although they have some work to do (I have been here twice, and both times, the waitstaff forgot multiple items on the order), they are nice people, trying to create a place where people can gather over a light meal and enjoy the space.  And a wonderful little space it is!  It really does have a nice VIBE: clean, modern, simple.  The food is similar: simple, not fancy, not stuffy.  And I really do love the coffee!  But really what impresses me most is that this little start-up has a pretty good crowd on a Saturday!  (I think that is a Billy Joel tune...)\n",

      "If you like great cappuccinos & Italian style panini's, this is your place. I drive past a lot of coffee shops multiple times a week to get to Altitude because there is more pride in their fares than most any other coffee shop around.

Cool, neon signs show where the various sections are (e.g., teen central, holds, romance, sci-fi, etc.).

      "They have good coffee that is undoubtable, but the interior is not set up for an ergonomic study area. The seats are hard and uncomfortable, the place is too dark (think throwback to 2000's Abercrombie dark), and the music is unbearably loud. Stopped in after hearing so many good things from people, but definitely not a convert. Might be great to grab a cup of Coffee and talk with a friend, but go elsewhere if you are trying to get work done.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",

I am coming back for more and making more excuses to drive to this side of town!  I need to try this broasted chicken!\n",

I ordered the Liquid Breaking Bad and it was delicious! Very strong but not at all bitter or sour or ashy like Starbucks. They offer soy milk and have some sugar-free syrups.

This man knows pretty much all there is to know about beans! He even treated me to a shot of espresso the way he likes it, which was delicious. The espresso has serious crema and tastes so clean and fresh. He then gave me a taster of the Burundi, which was out of this world! It's so sweet and bright and will be a great way to start out my mornings. \n",

      "We got a pound of Burundi and a pound of espresso blend to take home. If you buy beans and aren't going to use them right away, they're happy to seal the bag with nitrogen to keep it fresh for you. You definitely don't get this service at the chain shops. A pound of coffee was $14 and some change, which is an absolute steal for how fresh and unique their beans are. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a legit coffee house. In fact, their coffee shipments are on display underneath the menu. They only roast 5lbs at a time so you're getting fresh espresso - not something that's been open and growing stale for who knows how long.\n",

      "  In the past couple months, I have complimented my Boulder City adventures with a visit to Chilly Jilly'z. The leading visit was subsequent to a ride on the Historic Southern Nevada Railroad train. From the train, I saw a sign that when you show your railroad ticket you receive ten percent off Chilly Jilly'z. I had my mind set on dining in China Tango Bistro for dinner. However, a cold beverage would hit the spot. Fast forward to Chilly Jilly'z. The facade and inside remind me of a Happy place away from the city. It has that small town atmosphere. There was a sundry of seating with a large TV on the east wall and a self serve yogurt bar on the west wall. Over the counter in the center was a giant menu. With such a large selection it is difficult to make a decision. There are so many choices that adds to a high return factor. I decided on a sugar free strawberry Italian soda. It was okay. If the sugar free was okay I can imagine that the sugary Italian sodas are delicious. When I finished I ordered a cup of coffee. As far as their coffee, let me say that I will stick with Starbuck's. When I breathed in my olfactory sense was taking in the delicious smell of broaster chicken. It was a smell that stayed mentally in my head and led me back to Chilly Jilly'z two additional times. \n",

Chilly Jilly'z menu states, \"(Broaster Chicken) is a special cooking process guaranteeing practically oil free chicken while preserving most of the natural juices. Because of our special marinating, breading and cooking, the chicken has a crisp, tasty, golden crust.\" The broaster chicken meal comes in two styles: 1. leg & thigh ($7.99) or 2. breast and wing ($8.99). The meal includes a biscuit, 2 potato wedges (both times they gave me three) and a side. Beverages are separate. The broaster chicken is delicious high quality food that requires a ten to fifteen minute wait. My suggestion is that if you walk in with an intention of having dessert,  look through all the dessert choices on the menu. Regardless of how fond my taste buds were of the broaster chicken, they were ultimately fond of the potato wedges. Up to this day, they are the best potato wedges I ever had. The cole slaw was also delectable. \n",

      "This roaster and coffee shop is a fantastic addition to the coffee scene in Scottsdale.  As I write this I'm savoring a cup of Rwandan coffee from beans roasted just two days ago.  Roast is much lighter than what is common these days and I appreciate the flavors that are brought out because of it.  They roast their own beans on site and have a beautiful, newly built shop that is very bright with an abundance of natural light, very clean, and accompanied by warm & friendly service.  Espresso is among the best in the valley, and I was happy that they accommodated me on my request for a ristretto shot.  \n",

      "Richview Library is one of those locations that has really evolved to keep up with the times.  It is actually a medium sized library, though when you are in it, it seems much smaller.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I always thing of movie libraries, where they have endless halls of books or massive stacks where you can't reach the one book you need, or walls of books.  But the reality is, rich view is functional without living up to the movie hype libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The library really redid it self in the last few years.  It almost seems like technology and keeping up with the times, smashed into the old world library that was trying to keep pace.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The library is now split into 6 key areas.  Downstairs is the kids section, a great area for...kids.  Its got an open space that as a kid I thought was a massive auditorium, and has more than enough books to keep any kid entertained for hours (or days when I was a kid...honest, I was allergy to fresh air and sunlight!:( )\n",
      "\n",
      "At the top of the stairs to the kids area, you are at the entrance or the check out area.  Its now been converted from 6 check out stations to an open space where one wall has auto checkouts and a central section where you can get help and have a person help you check in\\/check out.\n",
      "\n",
      "to the far right of the building is the \"teen\" area.  Its awkwardly coloured (go and check it out) and has awkward couches and an awkward floor to ceiling glass wall to look through and see awkward teenagers adolesc-ing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main upgrade is right in front of the check in.  Its the 20 or so computers stationed there now.  This has evolved over time as computers have become a big part of our lives and ever year a visit to the library showed the prevalence of computers with the increase in space that it began to utilize.  There is free wifi in the library and the computers are free to use as well.  Its interesting to see so many people come to to library to just sit on their laptops and to see the computer area so full.  I almost wonder if people understand the beauty of a library or the feel of a book...maybe we just need to start building computer labs that have a no talking policy...that seems to be what most people go there for...\n",
      "\n",
      "But I digress, back to the areas.  If you've been counting, we have done 4 areas.  The 5th, I'm going to encompass as \"upstairs\".  Probably the least changed of all the areas, \"upstairs\" has been the same since 1990, when I first went to that library.  Even the rickety old desks and the guy at the help desk are the exact same...freaky.  Great area if you are looking to study, but the people at the help desk are sticklers for being quiet....so shhhhhhhhh\n",
      "\n",
      "Last bucket or area is just...everything else.  The book stacks, the hallways, the vending machine, the washrooms (I think only the \"upstairs\" and downstairs \"kids\" washrooms are available free and without needing to ask permission) are all there.  I call this the overhead!\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, the library has done a great job to upgrade it self but I can't help but be sad that with the advent of computers and peoples need for snippets of info vs deep data, that only a library can provide, that in a few years there won't be a condo in this place instead.\n",

      "Excellent quality coffee roasted right on the premises. I had an americano accompanied by a cheese danish. The danish wasn't bad, the coffee was superb. The place is small but the setup is really cool. They've made the roaster, espresso machines, grinders, big coffee bags, etc clearly visible, which gives the place a micro-industrial type of feel that combines with a small seating area with a tropical vibe to it (just as if you were sitting at a supplier's location in Honduras or Colombia). The owners are very friendly and Pam seems to make it a point to engage with every one of her customers individually. I'm very glad to have tried this place and will definitely be going back.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "This is definitely a nice alternative to the Starbucks and Second Cup that are literally across the street from Aroma. When this place first opened up I didn't think it had a chance, but now it seems to be busier than its competition!\n",
      "\n",
      "The place is spacious with the counter taking up a huge amount. But it seems to work more efficiently this way, like a Burger King. You place the order and they call your name. I got my coffee in about 30 seconds. Only problem was that there was no where to sit. The amount of laptops and people taking up entire tables to do their homework was a little upsetting. People would sit at a table for 3-4 with their papers all over the place and their bags and coats on the extra chairs. There has to be some way they can fix it so students don't loiter for hours with their laptops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bathrooms were in rough shape. The men's washroom looked like I was at a club, but I do like that they are proper washrooms for multiple people and you don't have to ask for a key from the counter. And I also like that you get a little piece of chocolate with your coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've only been here a couple of times and it's usually for things like cappuccinos and iced coffee, which are reasonably priced and tasted just fine. I would really like them to fix their seating. I went there with three other people and we couldn't get a table. That shouldn't be the case. Not to sound like an old man because I like working on my laptop in public as well... But don't forget us non-students who just want to sit down and enjoy our coffee, you know?\n",

All new tables and chairs, roll-up glass garage door let's all the summer air in.  Hands down best hot dog spot, bigger buns allow tons more toppings!  New expanded menu and full service wine, beer and liquor makes it a full service restaurant now.\n",

      "When this place first opened, it was a nice addition to RIDC Park - making fresh wraps, salads, and grilled cheese on their panini press. Now, their food menu has become much more limited. When I went in a month ago and again today their only food offerings were frozen Indian meals for lunch entrees and a few basic salads. While I admit the Channa Masala entree I had was tasty, the lady working told me that they buy it frozen from a bag, dump it out, and heat it up on top of rice for $8. I don't know what's happened, because this was a decent place to grab a sandwich and coffee a few years ago, and now their menu is 1\\/4 of the size and it's often deserted. I'm just not sure how they are able to keep their doors open, surely not with the sales of kitchy gifts. If you're looking for a lunchtime meal, skip Blue Elephant.\n",

      "I love the library and I love the Burton Barr library most of all. Compared to the other Phoenix libraries, this one is the king. It is located in the heart of downtown Phoenix, has multiple levels (in which you can ride a glass elevator) and it has so many square feet filled with books, audio tapes, DVDs, CDs, etc. It also has a café and ample amount of parking. I love visiting this library when I am downtown. \n",
      "\n",
      "Normally, I place an online hold for books. I really like this feature as I can browse online, find out when new books are available, and then place a hold. When the books are at the library, I can swing on down and pick it up. That way when I go, I'm never disappointed that my book isn't available. However, this particular location has A LOT of books so I've come with a list in mind and usually have been able to find every book. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would highly recommend stopping by this library if you are in the neighborhood, just for the experience. You could grab a cup of coffee at the café, or a snack, and then settle in for a good read. They also have computers if you need to do some research. Definitely check it out!\n",

      "I initially came to the Sahara West library every Wednesday for story time with my kids when one was 3 months old and the other was almost 4. On Wednesday at 10:30 AM they have a preschooler story time for kids who are 3-5. They read books, sing songs, and dance. At the end of every story time, they would be given a take home craft related to the theme of the story time of the week. My son's walls are now covered in library memorabilia. At the 11:30 story time, it is planned for children from birth up to 5 and sometimes plays parachute (the really big colorful one) at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that my daughter is 14 months old, she will not sit still so we don't go to story time anymore but we still go every Wednesday to get books, DVDs, CDs, crafts, coloring pages, etc. I never rent or buy any kids movies because the library has every children's movie ever made. The librarians are so amazing at talking to all the children, and even knows their names and tells them how happy they are to see them every week. I love this place and it has helped my son learn to already read. Bring your children here, you will thank me later.\n",

      "-they offer drink for take out as well\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "-none of their hot beverages are hot enough. The filter coffee was almost cold whereas filter coffee is usually steaming hot. The chai latte was also cold even though steamed milk was used.\n",
      "-their snacks are store bought basic stuff  like two-bite mini brownies, social thé biscuits, president choice cookies, and bananas. You won't get anything sophisticated such as croissants etc\n",
      "-if you're staying for ~3hrs or less it might not be worth it and also very expensive. You can usually stay the same amount of time at any other cafe and get better food such as sandwiches and stuff and still be paying around $9\\/$10\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion: come here thinking that you're paying for the space and not the food. A very office like space with office like kitchen and coffee. If you're hungry, you'd have to go somewhere else for food.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "It's your local cozy cafe to catch up with old friends or a corner for yourself to hide from daily life! Their mango ice creams pretty delicious, my friend lived their Turk coffee. Feels like home :) it's not as small as it looks from outside, I was pretty surprised when I walked in\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "One of my favorite places to stop and grab a quick breakfast. My favorite thing to get is the turkey sausage and cheddar egg sandwich on an asiago bagel. Service is very quick. Food is tasty. Atmosphere is cozy with a fireplace. Overall, awesome place!\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "I never knew what smooth coffee tasted like until I came here. So smooth, strong, and rich in flavor . The prices here are on point, my favorite is the flynn. The interior is spacious and cozy. Only complaint is that I wish they were open later so I can have coffee whenever.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "I was so excited to write a review about this place because of how awesome it is! I can now say why it has such high ratings!\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to other small cafes\\/coffee shops that I've been to, this establishment occupies a pretty big space. Not what you'd expect from the outside. They are able to accommodate more people this way and it doesn't make you feel squished. lol Plenty of tables and seating all around. There is also a table and a few chairs outside, next to the entrance. It would be a nice lil place to study, even for study groups, since the CSN campus is close by.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have great decor in the interior with plenty of inspirational words frames hanging on the walls. Each one being unique. Like the frames, all the tables and chairs are different too. I just love that idea in a cafe! It gives the feeling that the vintage decor and furniture were purchased from all over. Not having a unified theme as a theme. It gives this shop the stamp of a cafe's \"classic look.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I met up with my siblings when I went to go try this place, and upon entering, we were promptly greeted. We were asked by the guy (didn't catch his name) at the front counter if it was our first time here. He informed us about what items are their most popular and made some suggestions. It's also pretty neat that some of the menu items have a Breaking Bad theme.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a Hazelnut Latte and it was delicious! The quality and freshness of the drink were excellent. I love the added latte art too! We also tried a few of the pastries like their cheese danish and blueberry muffin. All were very good. With such a friendly staff and quality coffee, I will be returning! :]\n",
      "\n",
      "Pro-Tips:\n",
      "-It may be tricky when trying to find this place. The plaza itself is very small and the shop sits at the very end of the row, hidden behind a gas station and auto service building.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Let me preface this review by saying that I believe food service is at least half about customer service. That is where I think Espresso Royale falls way short.\n",
      "\n",
      "Make fun of Starbucks employees all you want, but I, for one appreciate a little friendliness with my coffee. Every time I go in to Espresso Royale in the 200 block, I feel as though I am a nuisance to the person behind the counter. She never smiles or says hello. Usually a short \"what would you like?\" I've tried to brush it off, but it's irritating!\n",
      "\n",
      "I like their prices, and the proximity to my work, but I think I'll seek caffeine elsewhere from now on. Lord knows there are enough coffee shops in the area...\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",

      "It's not your fault \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I am going to be 110% honest here, the reason my fiance and I ventured to Smelly Cat is because we just moved to the area and WE LOVE Friends. When we found out there was a coffee shop in town and that's down the road from us named Smelly Cat, it was a no-brainer. So, we jumped on our bikes and the story beings.\n",
      "\n",
      "WOW! Everyone and their Mom comes here. We visited Smelly Cat on a Sunday and I was nervous with the Farmer's Market next door and a number of dogs that we wouldn't be able to find a place to sit, but we did! \n",
      "\n",
      "All of their breakfast items are homemade, so if you get there late don't be surprised if that breakfast burrito you wanted is no longer there. Yuuup, that's what happened to us. Our barista pointed us in the right direction and we settled for a breakfast sandy with sausage, egg and cheese. I am pretty sure the biscuit is what made this sandy from meh to yum! \n",
      "\n",
      "Iced coffee lovers, this is your spot. With four, maybe five, different types of cold brew on draft. I don't see the problem. I went with the New Orleans style cold brew and I should have asked for more information. This was far too sweet for my likening, but now you know.\n",

      "AMAZING FIND!!! We stopped in mid-afternoon after our visit to the Hoover Dam. Thought it was an ice cream place, but oh boy, it is SO MUCH MORE than that!!! First impression ~ sparkling clean, inviting decor (just LOVED the outdoor seating under the terrace) & the staff ~ warm, friendly, all with a smile & genuine interest in taking care of us!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was 110 degrees & we were all a bit in need of a \"retreat\" & this place did the trick! Our only regret was that we only had room for ice cream ~ 4 of us had \"make your own\" sundaes, 2 had Mocha Frappes.  The \"make your own\" bar was FANTASTIC ~ you dream it, I bet they have it! My 2 teenagers were in HEAVEN!! The Mocha Frappe was REAL & the most delicious ever ~ we even got to choose our milk (almond for me)!  \n",
      "We drooled over the menu ~ in particular, I'd drive back to try the Dam Panini alone... but (sigh...), it's a long way from New Hampshire \n",

      "A lovely cafe that is well thought out and cozy, a perfect respite from whatever blistering cold weather Toronto is enduring for the day. There are three sofa\\/armchair areas, a handful of small two-person tables in the back, and a long communal table off to one side. If you are lucky, you can snag the coveted leather armchairs right in front of the fireplace. Also, there are conveniently placed outlets to plug in your electrical device of choice.... always very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drinks are prepared with attention and care from the staff, and everyone seems to enjoy the Turkish coffee which comes on a fancy silver platter set. The only drawback was that their wifi was sporadic. It would be fine on my phone but dead on my laptop.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "I love this place!! The coffee is delicious and doesn't tear up your insides like some other well known coffee establishments. Sometimes the little designs they make on top of the latte are so pretty that I almost feel guilty drinking the work of art...almost! The service has always been great and you can't beat the view. The patio is People and Dog friendly. People friendly because most of the patrons are cool and chill and not the Snottsdale type...most of them. The view is incredible...from sitting outside overlooking the lake and watching the fountain to the eye candy sitting at the table next you. ;-) \n",
      "On Thurs nights they have open mic night from 7:30 - 9:30(ish) and you can hear some really amazing music (not awful karaoke) and have a glass of wine, vodka, whiskey, coffee or all of the above. \n",
      "I hear they have music on Friday and Saturday nights as well but I haven't been there to experience that...yet! I'm sure it's amazing too!! If you're looking for a cool place to relax and take in some AZ beauty (in all forms) ;-) you'll love this place!!\n",

      "First, this is the Pinney branch - it doesn't say that in the header.\n",
      "\n",
      "What can I say? Public libraries are awesome and this one is no exception. There are thousands of books, plus magazines, video, audio and even tools (did you know you can check out tools?) all for free. There are plenty of places to sit, tables if you're trying to get work done, and computers for public use. There's also a big meeting room where they hold a nice variety of interesting events. There are several themed book displays around the library, which is nice when I wander in just looking for something, anything, to read. I think my favorite feature, though, is the hold service: you can request any item from any library in roughly half of the state, and it will be delivered to this library in short order. I know, it's a common library service these days, but have you ever stopped to think about how amazingly helpful it really is? And for free!\n",
      "\n",
      "My only disappointment is that the circulation desk staff are pretty consistently unfriendly. Rarely rude, never incompetent, just very few smiles and no unnecessary words. I hope they like their jobs more than they seem to!\n",

      "Things I have seen at this library:\n",
      "- Art work from my kid's school and several other area schools\n",
      "- Kids knitting\n",
      "- Bats & snakes\n",
      "- Kids reading to dogs\n",

      "This place is in non-descript strip mall on South boulevard. But head inside and you'll find a place full of ambience and vibe. This place is an amazing eclectic coffee shop and bar. Live music most nights seems to be a mix of talented local artist. Sarrah the owner is friendly and makes you feel very welcome. But the very best part.... They have honest to goodness authentic shave ice!\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "I feel like a lot of people take the P.C. library for granted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The circumstances behind its (sort-of) recent renovation were somewhat controversial -- a long story involving FRAM Development pledging to support the reno, getting pushback from the community, pulling their funds and the City having to step up and work at breakneck speed to finish the project in time -- but this site is the nicest in the city purely from an aesthetic standpoint. Yet every time I visit, even today, the place is practically empty. The place has more value for its parking lot, which inevitably gets packed any time there's a festival.\n",
      "\n",
      "The value of this site and its amazing selection shouldn't be understated. The library itself is a very minimalist affair, making it so that most of the shelves are about as high as the average adult so you can see 360 degrees around you almost anywhere you stand, and the building has half of the walls are just windows that allow you to look out at the Credit River and nearby bridge\\/lighthouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always love coming in here and browsing the new fiction and business writing sections, although the selection isn't nearly as good as Central Library. Then again, that was always a problem with this location, in that they never seemed to have half of what I was looking for. I still get a lot of mileage out of the book sale (small as it may be) and the magazines. It also gives me a kick that there's a video game section with a large number of titles for the XB1 and PS4 -- if I had either of those systems, I'd be renting stuff there religiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place isn't perfect. Aside from the somewhat-limited selection, the staff seem to be a bit aloof and distracted whenever I visited. Still, this is a beautiful site that has a lot of importance to the village and is a great place to visit and look for new titles. The modern design is just a nice bonus.\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "Coffee is pretty good - a little on the super sugary, sweet side for the iced mocha, but overall, I like it. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, service is severally lacking for what seems to be, \"non-regulars\". On first arrival, we are blocked out of the entryway because some old man and his wife and conversing with a man and his dog. Fine, but please, get out of the doorway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we are waiting in line, and the same man and his wife try to step in front of us even though we have been waiting in line. Really, really peculiar. I step in front and he kind of pops back in surprise as if I should have allowed him to get in front of me. And they talk about millennials having no manners... Yeesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "We place our order which includes 1 French press and a bagel, among other things. All people in the line behind us get their drinks before us, and not until the line clears does the worker grab the beans for the French press and after we ask sort of \"what's taking so long\", she says \"oh we're busy\". I'm sorry, but we placed our orders before your favorite old man and woman came in and they received their orders before us. A French press has to sit for a few minutes, so an efficient worker would have started making it long before. On top of that, I hear people getting their bagels before us, and we still haven't gotten ours. What is going on? Such a strange, elistist, \"we will take care of you when we feel like it\" attitude in there. It was almost as if they were punishing us for ordering a French press because they had to walk themselves over to the beans to grab them off the shelf. Sorry? \n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't even hear a \"sorry\" from the worker who was making the French press and taking ages to do so. Because I'm classy, I thank them for finally giving us the rest of our order, to which I receive a extremely fake \"your welcome\". \n",
      "\n",
      "These people are not friendly - maybe unless you visit them every few days and become a regular. Got a real yucky vibe in there. Philz Coffee would blow this place out of the water a million times over not just with efficiency, quality, but beautiful customer service that seems to be lacking oh so much in business these days.\n",

Good luck getting an outlet or some decent lighting, however.  I will have to give the award for worst lighting to Aroma, especially the back section of their Annex location. Their Eglinton location is really nice - a bit more spacious than its downtown counterpart.  That said, the Annex location has a great patio if you're lounging in the summertime. \n",

      "I've been to Aroma a few times and their quality is top notch for a café. In cold weather, I opt for the hot chocolate. It's one of my favourites. They add real mini chocolate bars in the drink for an extra sugar rush. They also give you a mini chocolate on the side (as with most of their drinks). I like that added touch. Their iced Aroma (light) is always great for a brain freeze (in the best possible of ways).  What I really like about Aroma, however, is that they don't skimp on their menu.  Their sandwiches are hearty and healthy. I always get their chicken salad or their salmon and cream cheese sandwich. Both will fuel you if you're hanging out for over two hours (yes, guilty!). \n",

      "In the field of architecture, the Modern Era refers to the time period when designers produced buildings that were supposed to be timeless. Ideally these structures were to have a very functional form with their sharp angles and use of common materials. Post-Modernism, as a design school, exists to playfully mock the \"serious\" designs of the Modern Era. Agave Library is the perfect example of everything that is wrong with Post-Modernism.\n",

I understand that some people out there don't have a clue about what's going on around them and allow their kids to play hide and seek and throw temper tantrums outside of the children's section but the librarians need to regulate.

      "I have to echo similar sentiments to other posters about the noise level in this library.  DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A QUIET PLACE TO STUDY OR READ.  I'm in my mid-twenties as well and have a small child.  So I would say I'm not that out of touch with society, people's needs in a library, etc. It's not just how rude most patrons are about talking loudly, or the staff's disinterest in reminding people to \"talk in your inside voice\" (Remember hearing that phrase as kids? I still teach my kid that concept.)  But it's the multiple tutoring sessions with children taking place all over the library...at full volume...and right on top of one another.  I'm a student myself and am trying to study as well, but it's extremely difficult to do when you are also hearing math lessons on measurements, grammar lessons on prepositions, and conversations about a kid swallowing a quarter all going on around you.  Right out in the open.  It's rude and inconsiderate of people to host lessons in out there like that.  They should be held in a conference room in the library, at the child's school, or heck even a fast food restaurant where wifi is free and noise and conversation is acceptable to be had there.  I don't understand why the staff allows these tutoring lessons to take place all over the library.  It completely undermines the purpose of the library.\n",

I did manage to pin the Manager down to a chat a few days later, but she wasn't helpful at all, just full of apologies, and even was cheeky enough to suggest that if I thought it was too expensive, I should go for one of their cheaper stylists at my next visit!

Apparently named as an acronym of the underlying motto \"to inspire and be inspired\" with free WiFi and an innovative drink list including a rich caramel and cocoa infused iced coffee for myself plus a heavily praised honey cream iced latte for my friend it was after only a few moments of indecision that our order was placed and chatting while we waited the tasting soon began with a duo of $2.50 \"lollies,\" the single strips of spongy dough pressed between hot metal proving paltry in portion and largely flavorless save for the sweet finishing drizzle that unfortunately warned of things to come.  Entirely eschewing savories in favor of items far more sweet it was after perhaps a twenty minute wait that our proper order arrived and beginning first with a doughy Belgian topped with fresh berries beneath artificial tasting chocolate I quickly turned my attention to the alternatives, the Elvis faring a bit better by balancing sweet and savory over a slightly more study base while the \"Honey I'm Home\" proved the best of bunch in its sugar-crisp coating overlying a somewhat dense crumb - its \"veganism\" thoroughly compromised by honey and ice cream but the result all the better for it.\n",

If this stylist had so much experience and skill, wouldn't she of asked me? And understood that, like the manager said on the 'phone, bobs come in many variations. The stylist did not ask if I wanted a graduated bob, she did however ask if it was ok to cut up to the hair line, I agreed, assuming the bob was taking shape. Alas, she thinned it so much, and I didn't see the back of head until after. I was used to a technical hair cut, being shown during the cut the back and sides of the hair (Neil Bartons)\n",

I love how la Finca offers isolated workspaces for people to work quietly. The café has beautiful decor and provides a great ambiance for studying, working and relaxing. The staff there is also very friendly and the service is quick. I didn't try any of their food, but when I looked at other people having lunch there, seemingly they offer quite a variety of light lunches that are very appetizing. The coffee is good and not expensive, I loved this place so much!\n",

As the reviewer before me stated, the location is ideal and the offices are lovely, but the customer service is atrocious. I had a one-year lease in the office with a number of challenges throughout my term. Unfortunately, my requests for assistance fell on deaf ears. The staff is trained to make money, NOT to help tenants. Below are some examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after I moved into the office, I was told that I could not use my AirPort to connect my Mac to my printer and make a wireless environment. That meant that I had to run wires across the office and inconvenience my clients when they visited the office. Apparently, had I paid an additional fee, I could have used my AirPort, which is NOT a router, as specified in my contract and verbally.\n",
      "\n",

      "Finally, after ending my lease, I was BILLED! The management requires a substantial deposit, yet I was billed for mail forwarding and cleaning. I had less than $3 worth of mail forwarded to me because I picked up the other pieces. I also never used or publicized the number provided by Corporate Office Centers, as I just forwarded my own number. Therefore, my COC number was not used, even though I still received a $375 fee. And cleaning a 125-square-foot office for $325? I have had my entire 1,300-square-foot home professionally cleaned for little more than that. That amount is ridiculous, especially since I cleaned all surfaces before vacating.\n",

I would have liked an additional hit of acidic flavor or a different texture to balance out the creaminess and smooth textures of the avocado and eggs, maybe a thin slice of tomato on top or pickled onions would help?

      "I should also note that I am a hard core reader and have a doctorate degree - although unemployed, so I am picky about my libraries. My unemployment allows me to explore and spend most of my free time reading in libraries - and all public libraries are still free...\n",
      "\n",
      "The reading selections are quite good here. They have a very good and wide selection in the humanities. They have a very good catalogue and even a Special Collections room with local Phoenix archival material. Like most public libraries, everything is catalogued in the Dewey System: 000-900. I have spent hours in here just browsing and reading some real gems, everything from the Colonial History of French Canada to Pre-Socratic Philosophy to Baudelaire's Fleurs du Mal. \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff are pretty helpful, well-mannered and nice overall. Generally, there is always some rude librarian in most libraries - I still have not encountered one inside of here. This is a very good point. \n",
      "\n",
      "The architecture is quite good and appealing for readers. It is airy, very spacious, open, not overwhelming at all with the usual long large bookcases. Because of this openness in design, it is enjoyable to browse the shelves here. It is  a mixture of Miami Art Deco and the Open Use Space designs, which one often sees in the corporate structures in San Mateo County, California. We are in the Valley of the Sun, as they call it. \n",
      "\n",
      "As long as the other patrons do not talk in loud voices, their conversations are not annoying. This is often not the case in most older libraries, mostly built about 100 years ago. \n",
      "\n",
      "The library is accommodating for all types of humanity. I really mean this. There is a large homeless population both inside of the library and in the general vicinity of the library. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would not take a walk around the neighborhood however, because it is a strange mixture of homeless encampments, heroin junkies, and large official arts buildings, such as the Art Museum, the Opera House, the Theater House, the School of the Arts, the Irish Cultural Centre, Mexican and Asian fast food dumps, Mainline Protestant Churches - and if one can believe it, massive construction projects for high priced condos! \n",
      "\n",
      "There are also abandoned, lonely sitting, decayed buildings for sale with ominous fences around them, so the homeless don't squat them. Phoenix shares the degradation of official criminal neglect, found in most medium to large sized American cities. Stay away from the park area near Central Ave and the library too. The parking lot of the library also has some Class B trailer, full time living, nomadic people. If you park your vehicle, leave it near the main entrance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because of this American urban dynamic, the security personnel inside of the main library are somewhat nervous and intense. The don't carry guns - but they do stare ominously when you look at them. \n",
      "\n",
      "The hours are good, from the morning until well into the evening. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another great thing that they do is they automatically extend books when you take them out. Patrons can borrow up to around 30 books at one time. They are definitely not trying to nickel and dime patrons as many libraries do - if they happen to miss the date of extension. If a patron needs your book, then you will be sent a hold notice and must return the monograph. \n",

I got conflicting instructions on both my visits, the first time the lady told me I didn't need to wait in the long line for a quick coffee (people line-up for sandwiches and that takes at least 5-10 minutes). So when I went in for my 2nd visit, I sheepishly asked if it was OK if I cut in line to get a coffee and another lady told me I needed to go all the way back in the line. OOOOOK. She was polite about it even though I was really confused.\n",

Pointless. I could have easily had my coffee made, paid and took off. So instead they lost a sale and earned a mediocre review.\n",

It's a decently sized coffee shop with several tables, large windows at the front and an average decor. When I arrived, it was pretty full but I was able to get a table.

Soft and buttery and fresh - it was pretty big too. These guys also offer breakfast (basics) in case you're feeling super peckish. \n",

      "Service: Great! The two people who were behind the counter were really friendly, and even though the check-in offer was for a medium or large 'specialty' coffee, they gave me the croissant because technically, a Macchiato is a specialty coffee - you just can't size it up.\n",

When we got there it was around 9pm and we wanted to get coffee and dessert and play a game of scrabble. There were a couple of tables outside and a few wicker benches to choose from. One table was occupied with a group of friends and their very loving and playful dog. Another table had a musician playing the xylophone. At one of the wicker benches, there was a small group playing the guitar. We snagged an empty four top and proceeded w\\/our scrabble game. Several pedestrians with dogs and children walked by. As the night progressed, a drum circle formed around the xylophone player and they created magical music. Many people who walked by stopped to dance and interact with the musicians. Inside the cafe as more people came in, there were others like us who cracked open board games and drank their coffee and chatted away.

But it was a yummy hot chocolate tasting drink. It could have been hotter (temperature-wise) though.

      "I am a little obsessed with this place. I look forward to going to Boulder City just so I can make my way though Chilly Jilly'z menu. This cute little restaurant has so much to offer! Custard, frozen yogurt, salads, fried chicken, fish and chips, wings, sammies, burgers, and delicious picks from the bakery. I'm sooo obsessed!\n",
      "So far I've tried:\n",
      "- Pinapple Dole Whip float, it's refreshing and deliciously tart. Great treat for a hot day;\n",
      "- Broasted chicken, potato wedges, and mac n cheese, the chicken was BOMB! Juicy, tender, and not heavily breaded - so freaking good! The potato wedges were great as well, I had to add some salt (I typically like my food salty) but they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside = perfect. The mac n cheese was great too.\n",
      "- Fried fish filets, tater tots, cole slaw -broasted fish filets that also, weren't heavily breaded. Four come in an order, and they seemed pretty fresh. I subbed crinkle fries for tater tots and they were wonderfully crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The cole slaw was ok. The fish comes with home made tartar sauce that has a good consistency and flavor.\n",
      "- Best Damn Pastrami Burger - really the best damn pastrami burger I've had! Juicy and flavorful, omg so good! You can get any burger wrapped in lettuce, great option when you're being skinny.\n",
      "- Go Go Green smoothie - is the only thing I really didn't care for. The smoothie has kale, carrots, broccoli, apples, and cinnamon. I tasted a lot of broccoli and cinnamon, which made it weird for me... \n",
      "- Energy ball, was pretty darn good! I tried making those on my own before and it did not taste like the one I had here. It had coconut, chocolate chips, oatmeal, and peanut butter, I'm sure among other things. Great combination and texture, it filled me up as well. Definitely something I'd get again.\n",
      "- Chocolate chip and cherry cookie - really tasty. I thought the combination was interesting and it turned out to be delicious as well.\n",
      "I also enjoy the staff here. All of the workers seem to be teens and are super sweet. Always smiley and helpful. Super clean too!\n",

      "Nice-looking building from the outside, w\\/ beautiful views of one of the man-made lakes nearby.  I really enjoyed the walks I took in the park that this branch is located in.  Using the library though, is another story.  In the times I've visited, this location was either closed or full of noisy children and pre-teens who ran in and out of its doors unattended and people of all ages who talked loudly on their cellphones.  The computer section was always crowded, and I could never find a seat to use or an empty table void of backpacks and other items left there by their absentee owners.  I'd say that, for the most part, this library looked and sounded more like a coffee shop (there's a section where you can purchase coffee and some pastries) than a quiet library where one may hope to do some productive work.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a good-sized selection of CDs, DVDs, and books-on-DVDs, which I used a couple of times, that allowed you to place holds on-site and online, and this service was fairly prompt at notifying me of the availability for pick-up, but I quit using the services when my hands, and anything that the items touched, started to smell of body odor from the previous users that handled them!  (I think that many of the handlers carried the items under their armpits as they walked back to the library, which I'm sure we've all done before w\\/ books and other items, but think about it-- we do live in the middle of the desert, and bodies do get hot and sweaty...)  No matter how many times I wiped the items down w\\/ sanitizing cloths and washed my hands w\\/ soap AND sanitized them, the odor wouldn't disappear!  Utterly disgusting, and I'm not exaggerating!  Don't believe me?  Pick up a DVD or book on your next visit and take a whiff...  Don't say I didn't warn you!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Come for the relaxing\\/energizing walks and views around the lakes.  There's even a playground or two on the other end of the park for children to play in, and many picnic areas w\\/ grills and tables to use.   You can even go fishing!  [Just don't expect to eat what you catch, though-- the lakes are contaminated w\\/ toxins and algae (there are signs), and I've seen more than a few floaters and dead small animals bobbing in the water.]  If you plan to walk all of the paths, make sure you have a friend or two accompanying you, esp. around sunset, bec. there's a specific location that only has one entry and exit, which could become dangerous-- if someone's stalking or following you w\\/ malicious intent, well, you're S.O.L.  \n",

      "The food and the wait. My wife ordered the banana Nutella waffle which came out first and the waffle was overcooked and very dry. The Nutella was flavorless and limited as it was drizzled on. My only other experience to compare this type of waffle with was at Disneyworld and there waffle was moist, soft and warm with the Nutella adding a great accent. \n",
      "I ordered the hashtag waffle and a banana Nutella for me. The hashtag was again an overcooked, dry and burnt in some areas waffle with turkey sausage that tasted like they came out of the frozen foods section at Von's supermarket.  Completely flavorless. The egg that came with it I cannot not even explain what it looked like.  My banana Nutella waffle did not even look like my wife's as by the time I got it I was told they were having issues with there waffle maker. It reminded me of one my 12 year old made me for Father's Day. \n",

      "The Ugly\n",
      "Due to technical problems everything took twice as long as long as it should.  I even saw A gentleman get up who had been waiting there before us asking why was it taking so long for his food.  For my inconvenience of waiting so long they offered me a cookie. At that moment they should've offered to discount my food at least. \n",

Retails for $40-$50 as we called around and you charged $127.
