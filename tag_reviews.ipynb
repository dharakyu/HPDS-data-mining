      "cute little library. the building was a former church but has been a library for 90+ years. the children's section is on the top floor. if you are  n the picture book room you have big windows that allow you to look out on gerrard street. they have a good selection of children's graphic novels and books in many languages. we saw french, hindi, urdu etc.  the tables and benches on the second floor are beautiful. looks like they came from a church. \n",
      "\n",
      "we have a habit of visiting libraries in our vacation locations. the librarians seemed seemed surprised that we were tourists visiting the library but quickly got used to our questions and gave us a history of the building.\n",

      "\n",
      "once inside you might, if your like me, get a sense of being in a harry potter movie. the first floor is a circular one encased in clear glass so you can see the endless column of books safely tucked in their shelves and bathed in an ambient orange glow. \n",

      "you can look but you cannot touch is the motto here, unless by special request in a sealed off room. \n",

      "completely free and open to all members of the public (not just university of toronto students!), this place is pretty awe-inspiring. shelves upon shelves of the rarest books and manuscripts in the country line the walls, and although you can't touch anything without asking a librarian's permission, it's still interesting to venture inside and take a quick picture. \n",

      "bagels on greene is as aptly named as dollarama is. the former serves some bagels, but it's a tiny minority of what they offer in the same way that dollarama still has *some* items at $1. \n",

      "summary: \n",
      "a great bagel place and cafe with a wide variety of quality food. a bit on the expensive side but not horribly so. it's a great place to stop and get a snack or a meal, or grab bagels and other food to go. \n",
      "\n",
      "detailed: \n",
      "bagels on greene is that, but also a lot more. they have sandwiches, wraps, breakfast, indian and mexican options, smoothies, jewish staples, salads, and soup all available while you're there. they also have plenty of things available as take-away options to complement later meals. the location itself is nice and relatively tidy, though can feel quite crowded during busier times given how much is offered relatively in their space. \n",
      "\n",
      "it's a bit on the expensive side, though not to the point where you feel like you checked going to this place off your list and it's probably too much for you to come back regularly (it's westmount, so not unexpected). \n",
      "\n",
      "the only critique is that sometimes the staff is rushed to make your food and doesn't quite get your order right. for example, during my most recent visit i ordered the smoked meat sandwich on a sesame bagel with mustard, cheese, and tomatoes. i got without cheese and tomatoes but with lettuce (as pictured - still great though!). it's not the first time something like this has happened (in my five or so visits) so don't be afraid to casually check your food if you're eating there!\n",

      "in front of the entrance there are statues that my oldest loved to take pictures by.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "across the street, you'll find a nice park with water fountains and exercise equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "the interior is fun and interesting. there are some interactive displays but i believe they're more for kids under 8. my daughter went through them quickly and was a bit bored with them. she still liked the trolley and thought the selection of books was cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "i like the family bathrooms and numerous places to sit. i didnt see a changing station for the baby but i couldve missed it. \n",
      "\n",
      "i was able to charge my cell phone while she played with a few toys. the theater was closed when we were there. \n",

      "we both thought it was the coolest library and had a good time for about an hour.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "i was impressed with the diversity of their collections. they have chinese, french, italian, spanish, gujarati, tagalog, tamil, hindi, turkish, and vietnamese books and dvds. there are lots of available computers upstairs and downstairs. many tables and chairs for reading, studying or doing work. they have an auditorium that seats 74, three meeting rooms and even a kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "some of the staff are friendly while others are a little cold but all were helpful. \n",
      "\n",
      "only two bathrooms with one stall each, the bathroom downstairs was dirty. with dated furnishings and large stains in the carpet, this branch is badly in need of a renovation. \n",
      "\n",
      "it was a tuesday night at 7:30pm and the place was noisy with lots of kids, better to come earlier on a weekday when kids are in school.\n",

      "i found leah through my wedding venue & the moment i met her i knew she was the right woman for the job. her cakes are delicious & her baking history has such a great story, it really hits home for a sentimental junkie like me. \n",
      "\n",
      "when trying to plan my wedding cake she invited me out to her home to drink coffee & eat cake, that's amazing in itself. but her warmth & passion really shine through when you start trying all of the flavor options & creations she makes available. \n",
      "\n",
      "i fell in love with her lemon cake (and will be finding a time to get another one!), it was my favorite. we also decided on coconut & vanilla for our other flavors of our 3 tier cake. there's a beautiful picture that leah has posted. i knew i wanted something more traditional and wanted to stay away from the fondant (personal preference). when planning she asked about our theme & who we were as people so she could get an idea of what to make. my husband thought she was wonderful too! \n",

      "this place is amazing! it was my second time using their services and i am very impressed. i called in on a tuesday to place a custom birthday cake order that needed to be picked up by saturday, and they were able to pull it off (and not to mention that it was the week of fourth of july). ordering was very convenient, i didn't even have'to go into the store until it was time to pick the cake up.  everything was done via email and phone which was great since i was so busy.  i emailed the owner pictures of what i wanted (she was very professional, informative and helpful), i paid over the phone and received my receipt via text message instantly. the cake was delicious and everyone enjoyed it! i recommend them and will definitely be using their services in the future.\n",

      "phoenix is filled with corporate businesses so a place like this seems extra special! first of all, western  avenue in general seems like it belongs in some town in the middle of nowhere- it has such a quaint feeling. i loved the bright green exterior of kreative kupcakes, and the inside is also cute to match!  the open kitchen looked clean and well cared for.  the cupcakes were super flavorful, moist, and definitely worth the price... the coffee was great too. we loved the ambiance and the sinful treats!\n",

      "\n",
      "when i first heard about co-working i thought it sounded, frankly, a little weird. i'd used co-working spaces while out of town on business and thought that was probably all i would ever use them for. the idea of using a local co-working space never occurred to me until i started becoming seriously frustrated because i wasn't looking for a \"third place\" i was looking for a place to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "i first started \"dropping in\" to co+hoots because i was working on a big project remotely and i needed a professional productive business environment. i had to make frequent conference calls and i was concerned about inappropriate background noise at home or at the coffee shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "the diversity and creativity of the people that use the space are very impressive. some people expect it to be full of \"creative professionals\" meaning, people that work primarily in communications and design. i certainly expected that when i first learned about it. while there are a good number of design and communication professionals here, what i found was that the creativity is much more about entrepreneurialism and innovation across all aspects of business.\n",
      "\n",
      "within a month i was \"dropping in\" every day. the team that runs the space is very attentive to the needs of everyone that uses the space, so it's comfortable and productive for me. the thing i didn't expect was the working friendships i've created. i feel more connected to the other professionals that i have met and gotten to know at co+hoots than i ever did in a regular job. i'm a bit of an extrovert though, some folks that use the space don't look for that and that's cool too.\n",

      "\n",
      "first off, there are young kids working at this place, good for the owner to hire local kids.  but they are obviously not trained well.  and after a few minutes of the employee not being able to figure out how to ring us up he asks a slightly older employee to help.  she comes over to help and someone else (i assume the manager or owner because he was the only adult there) yells at the girl to \"go on\" and shooed her away.  the guy fumbles for a while longer but with the little time she was able to help, most of our order was entered.  we paid.  he fumbled, and it took way too long, but we paid.  not one other employee acknowledged us.\n",
      "\n",
      "then 2 of the 4 employees that were there made our drinks together.  2 drinks and we were in there for well over 10 minutes.  the older guy left, leaving 3 employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "we got our drinks and left, and as soon as we got in the car my 12 year old said her strawberry raspado tasted like alcohol smells.  i tasted it and the fruit had fermented.\n",
      "\n",
      "i took it back in, explained to them what happened.  the older (maybe young adult) kid said, well, we put it on ice so i don't know what happened.  i asked more questions...  \n",
      "me:how long does the fruit stay out?  \n",
      "employee: we leave it out from open to close but it is on ice.\n",
      "me:  how often do you change the fruit throughout the day?\n",
      "employee: whenever we run out.  i mean, we can't tell when the fruit goes bad so thanks for coming in and telling us, we do put it on ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "umm, i'm pretty sure there are food regulations and rules for restaurants that specifically tell you how long to leave food out.  and, having something on ice doesn't mean that the whole thing stays cold.... just the part that is touching the ice.  \n",
      "\n",
      "i won't go back.  i can't trust that their food is safe and properly handled- that sucks!  and i don't like the way the guy treated his employees and he didn't even acknowledge us as customers.  bad business practice and bad food do not belong in laveen.\n",

      "best coffee shop i've been to so far. going in, you are greeted by the wonderful smell of coffee as well as the equally wonderful staff. looking around, it has a quaint atmosphere that is just ideal for a quiet workplace. posters reinforcing the store's love of coffee decorate the walls. sacks of the coffee are placed all over the store to add to the whole coffee theme.\n",
      "\n",
      "the menu board is written on blackboards above the counter and they are neatly laid out and organized. they even have a breaking bad themed menu! not only were they cute and creative, but they are also delicious! the coffee was strong and full of flavor. the amount of love and care they put into making their coffee really shows in the greatness of their product. best coffee i have ever tasted. i really cannot rave enough about how great their coffee is. it is so good! and they give you a stamp card!\n",

      "desert wind coffee roasters popped and after skimming a few of their amazing reviews my coffee radar was at full attention, thank god that my pants were stretchy. this small coffee shop offers bold coffee concoctions, sweet coffee drinks, and a mean espresso drink. i ordered an espresso over ice, but the gentleman behind the counter suggested a hot espresso, in fact a double espresso and he assured me it would be smooth. fugg it, lets do this. \n",
      "\n",
      "he gave me a ristretto, which is basically two shots of concentrated espresso, but it still fits in a standard espresso cup. yowza, i felt like one of the avengers after sipping this amazing drink. seriously, i \"hulked\", out in a good way, and was off, feverishly tapping away at my computer. this drink was so smooth and tasted very clean for a double espresso, with surprisingly no bitter espresso aftertaste.\n",
      "\n",
      "i was so stoked on this place that i had to introduce myself before taking off, it turned out the fella with the great suggestion was none other than the owner himself. joe and i ended up chatting for about forty-five minutes about coffee, his background and the new \"breaking bad\" themed coffee menu. \n",

      "\n",
      "for my drink i decided on the iced matcha green tea latte ($4.95).  a pro about this place is that they offer all of the different non-dairy options for your drinks (soy milk, coconut milk, almond milk) so my fellow lactose intolerant brethren rejoice!  after i paid i was given a stamp card with my name on it, the great thing about this place is that they have a stamp card holder for all their patrons in the back of the shop so that's one less stamp card that'll get lost in my wallet.  my latte was brought out fairly quickly to me and it was delicious!  a little on the sweet side so if you don't like your coffee drinks too sweet i would not recommend this specific drink though.  i saw that they do have different types of international coffees and different type of espressos so i'll definitely be back to try the different offerings they have.  overall i really liked this place!\n",

      "\n",
      "the registration process was much smoother than the toronto public library too. we just had to take our address proof and they had a computer where we could just make an account and use our own username (unlike typing in the tediously long library card number). then we get a confirmation number...just take a picture of it to the reception and they will issue you a card. they even have a small card for your keychain which makes it really convenient. the library staff is always friendly and helpful.\n",

      "the decor in the place is great without being untastefully too cool. the staff were really friendly. i was there about 90 minutes or so before the lunchtime rush, so it was actually pretty quiet in the place (minus the 1990s dance music playing in the background when i first got there , which didn't quite create an ambience). considering there were very few people there when i arrived, i was able to get a comfy seat and table right by the door, which helped provide some interesting people watching that made for some fun distractions from my work. \n",

      "\n",
      "here's the thing about the major changes with the char\\/meck library systems as of late, because of the budget squeezes, funding cuts and closings around the county, the libraries are really full at really odd times. like a tuesday afternoon. i figured this out yesterday as i tried to grab a cubby and get some work done. no such luck. no open tables, either. and really though, i can't blame them. this particular branch is pretty small and doesn't have a ton of \"working\" space. plus, because many of the other (larger) branches are closed on tuesdays, the myers park branch gets a ton of their overflow. \n",
      "\n",
      "thus, the library was chock full of kids, internet surfers and folks coming in and out to use their services. i take no issue with the crowded factor, as this branch is clearly serving its community and its needs. yay for that! just keep it in mind that this may not be as quiet as you think!\n",

      "the folks who work here are very, very sweet and helpful. not only did they help me find a few books for an upcoming beach trip, but i also overhead them helping anyone and everyone with a question or issue. as previously mentioned, there is a bank of individual cubbies for the working bees and a few tables near the back if you're lucky enough to score one. literature wise, this is a small branch. but i highly recommend searching for your books online and you can request that the be put on hold at whichever branch you like. thus, whichever library that has said book(s) will send them over to the myers park branch (or whichever branch you designate online) and they will notify you when they are ready to be picked up. stroll on over to the branch, pick up your books, hit up the self-checkout and poof! instant literature bliss.\n",
      "\n",
      "a few other things to note about this particular location: the parking is easy but can be tight when they are busy. they offer free wifi and have a small, but diverse, selection of magazines and media at your disposal. here's hoping that the county figures it out and supports our library structure as a whole. they should be open every day, folks.\n",

      "- check any judgey, homophobic, xenophobic, racist, or otherwise backwards mentalities at the door. they are not welcome. \n",
      "- that being said, keep an open mind and a \"ready for anything\" attitude about you as it's really a place more geared for adults who can and do speak their mind. just remember, keep it respectful.\n",

      "the library is about the life and ministry of the evangelical pastor billy graham.  there is a lot of video footage, which means the museum does not get boring.  i found it to also be a good reflection of the times he lived in and the subjects he addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "i learned billy graham was an advocate of civil rights, and he encouraged people to \"love your neighbor\", no matter what race they were.  he was, as expected, very conservative about \"the sexual revolution\"--however, he seemed to care about women as human beings, and his wife was a strong, well-educated woman.  \n",

      "this was a marvelous tribute to mr. graham and his wife ruth. there was something for everyone. when we arrived there was a group of school children just before us. they were at an automated cow who was telling the story of how billy graham started out on a farm. from that point groups were moved from mini theaters where bite-sized bits of information was given about billy grahams life, but also and most importantly within the context of the times - this acted as a point of reference. throughout the mini theaters were artifacts galore, with rooms set up to be representational of places. my favorite were storefronts with old time televisions that all aired mr. graham preaching to the masses. i also liked the ussr \"room\" that had a guard house and many other items that showed the separation from the east and west and it's eventual collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "truly, the entire museum was inspirational and of course, pointed the way to jesus as the glory was not on the graham's but the unfathomable message of love that jesus has for us all. \n",

      "don't get it twisted, this is not a library.  billy graham library is a sanctuary and museum dedicated to the life of billy graham.  i went to the 'library' with a laptop in my backpack ready to write.  i was greeted by a young man at the gated entrance at about 9:20.  \"the library will be open in about ten minutes sir,\" he said.  \n",
      "\n",
      "after parking i chatted with the security guard outside of a botanical garden and pathway to the entrance of the huge barn-like building decorated with a fifty foot crucifix.  this place was beautiful.  down the pathway speakers set the atmosphere with church choir music.  i walked into the immaculate building.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\"i believe i have the wrong idea, i thought this was a public library,\" i told the door-woman.  no worries a few joyful women at the information center directed me to the nearest location.  i didn't stay for the billy graham presentation, but the building had gifts and large pictures of billy.  if you are a christian enthusiast, you would love it here.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "i was in the area for free peach ice cream at the regional farmer's market when i noticed the billy graham library was nearby. i'm not exceptionally religious and i don't attend church anymore, but my entire family is extremely involved in their personal relationships with jesus, so i figured i'd go in and get them some merch. plus it's rated as a top destination in charlotte.\n",
      "\n",
      "the entrance was easy. lots of trees for shade, which provided for a peaceful vibe. the parking lot is huge -- and quite packed -- and is directly next to billy graham's rebuilt childhood home and the library building, which has a large glass cross built into it. the idea is that we enter through the foot of the cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "a lovely older lady opened the door to the library, asked if it was my first visit, and told me to go to information to get a pamphlet about the \"journey of faith\" tour. the woman who greeted me at the information desk was so sweet that i couldn't get myself to say, \"i actually just came in for a magnet\" and soon i was standing in front of a talking\\/singing cow waiting for the introductory presentation to begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "an hour and a half later, i had made my way through several videos documenting billy graham's life and that of his family members, a ton of artifacts, a room dedicated to his late wife, and even some international displays. the final room is aptly a salvation theater, where folks can hear the gospel message. prior to walking in, cards are provided to say if you accepted jesus into your heart or nah, and you can speak with a guest counselor after if you'd like to pray or learn more.\n",
      "\n",
      "now i grew up in the church and under the influence of graham's teachings. that provided a good base to understand his ministry. i'm not sure how the museum would feel without a similar background. i know they're welcoming to anyone and everyone, and the people working throughout seriously could not have been nicer, but i'm sure it's a different experience. i'd say if you want to learn about christianity and graham, this is a nice, nonjudgmental place to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "now, there are things about and ideologies of billy graham that i personally do not like. he certainly hasn't been free from controversy over the years, and his family's outward, ongoing support of donald trump -- a horrible, disgusting man who degrades women, the disabled, and attacks the press whenever he can -- is truly mind-boggling to me. just seeing trump's face inside on the presidents wall made me audibly cringe. i really do not like that man, and i don't see how he's any sort of testament to christian teachings.\n",
      "\n",
      "but of course, i don't agree with all of graham's own beliefs about women either. like the so-called \"billy graham rule\" -- his practice of not spending alone time with women other than his wife before she passed away in 2007. i think that's outdated, absurd, and unrealistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "so i'd say going into the museum with an open mind is key, no matter your personal beliefs. billy graham, 98, is and has been a huge evangelist figure since 1949 in the states and across the globe. it is possible to view the museum primarily from a historical and cultural standpoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "beyond the actual exhibits and videos, there's also a huge gift shop with loads of books. i picked out one for my mom about prodigal children, of who i technically am, so i know she'll love it. i also snagged some affordable home decor items for family members, and a couple bookmarks. i actually never even bought a magnet.\n",
      "\n",
      "after the bookstore, it's also possible to stop and eat in their on-site cafeteria. i opted to since i was hungry and it was right there\\/cheap. a combo chicken salad croissant, potato salad, and large coke only set me back $9.15. nice!\n",
      "\n",
      "in addition to his home and the library building, there's also a small memorial garden where graham's wife is buried. it's quite serene.\n",
      "\n",
      "on my way out the door, the same lady i spoke to earlier at information asked about how i felt, encouraged me to take a visitor survey, and gave me a free etched tote with a prayer book and readings inside, which i will pass along. she said, \"god bless you\" as i left, and i returned the sentiment.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "this is a nice place for contemplation, or to learn about billy graham. \n",
      "we came here because we needed to find something to do that was open on a monday afternoon, and was free. we found it! they don't charge for parking, or admission! \n",
      "the staff was incredibly pleasant. they all were quite interested in making sure you find the tour, find the exits, and find jesus. \n",
      "the exhibits were rather well done, taking you through billy graham's early preaching life, his meeting with rich and powerful people, and writing his weekly newspaper column. \n",
      "i was taken aback a little bit by how extravagant this place seems. it seems a bit prideful to build a museum about yourself, especially when the subject is still alive. i kept asking myself how many hungry mouths could've been fed instead of building this place. \n",
      "but the grounds were really nicely kept, and the whole place seemed to be like hanging out at ned flanders' house. \n",
      "the tour takes about an hour or so, with movies every several minutes that you're forced to sit through. they close the doors up, so you don't really have the option to be bored and race through the museum. \n",
      "they do have a book store at the end of the tour, filled with religious books. it is a library, i suppose.\n",

      "--------\n",
      "i came to this location with 120 kindergarteners for a field trip. we went directly to the second floor which is all for the kiddos. it was clean and very well organized. having the area divided up helps with the noise and general chaos of the children's section. i loved all the extra games, comfy chairs, posters, and smiles by all the staff. i did not get to visit any other part of the library but i am thankful for the loving and caring way our students were treated- for many, it was their first experience at a library. it was great to hear some say they couldn't wait to return.\n",
      "--------\n",
      "this library definitely has the charming vintage feel to it.  but it is fairly large with a good diverse collection of books and periodicals for library patrons to read on premise or check out. besides the expected books & videos checkout service that we have all come to expect of public libraries, there are also meeting and theater space on premise that hosts events throughout the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "the theater is pretty big, about the size of a decent size lecture room with theater style seating. besides the used book store (my favorite), the theater is the main reason for me to visit here when hosting special events like lecture series, entertaining programming, and informative discussion panels.\n",

      "there are also computers with internet access available on both a first come first serve basis and those that can be reserved in advance with your library card.  a very nice service for those without access to the computer or internet at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "the collection of foreign language magazines is also very respectable.  i especially enjoy browsing the japanese magazines with the glossy food pictures with recipes that i sadly can not read.  but sometimes it is fun and inspiring just to see the pictures.  but there are also additional english language-based publications from the uk and australia in this collection (located on the basement level, same floor as the theater).\n",

      "quick, yummy, great family place! to my delight, the menu was much more diverse than expected but i ordered a hot dog anyway -- the cuban dog was perfection! tater tots automatically put this place on my favorites list and i'll definitely be back to sample more...can't wait!\n",

      "this library has gone through plenty of renovations throughout the years i lived here, becoming much more \"modernized\" than what it started out originally as. as it sits now, it's a rather large library that houses what most institutions like these carry. \n",

      "from the main entrance, you can either head left to go straight into the children's area or proceed farther back and then make a left to head to the fiction\\/non-fiction section along with the dvd's, blu-ray's, and cd's. the spaces between the shelves are quite wide and the high ceilings make the entire library feel very spacious and welcoming, perfect for browsing, reading, or using one of their many computers they have available.\n",
      "\n",
      "it's generally neat from what i've seen with most of the left behind books neatly stacked on carts out of public view but the cd's and dvd's tend to be misfiled quite frequently like finding a u2 album placed under a taylor swift album...clearly two that don't belong together but i'm not sure how the filing system works here so this may be considered normal by the libraries standards. dvds can be a pain because they tend to keep the dvds in the cases which can easily be opened and very likely, be stolen given the person who is committing the crime is resourceful enough to not be caught. i do hope more secure measures will eventually be taken because with each item stolen, its one item less for a patron such as myself to check out and view.\n",
      "\n",
      "as a benefit, if you don't want to wait in the check out line, you can always just use the self-check out lines that they have here. i only saw that they had two available but they are fairly quick and easy to use if you are a repeat visitor but for first-timers, it can be a difficult system to operate but with a few more tries, it will come naturally.\n",

      "\n",
      "it's a big space for a gallery; has some movable walls i believe, and has a few different rooms. probably not the ideal space to hang paintings on the wall, because it's so big... but perfect for sculptures or interactive exhibits or even installation artwork. or a combination of the kind.\n",

      "upon placing our order, my sister and i decided to stay and enjoy the items we ordered. we had the privilege of being served by jezebel. who we initially taught was the owner because she was multi-tasking from the front counter, kitchen, lobby & outdoor patio. we were greeted upon sitting and told us that she will assist us. she approach us in a pleasant manner and ask us what kind of drinks we like. my sister got a dirty chai latte and for myself, the vanilla honey latte. we also got the mini cheesecake.\n",
      "\n",
      "now onto the items that we got. from the first sip of my vanilla honey latte...oh honey it was delicious!! the honey was paired well with the vanilla taste of the latte, consistent and balanced of sweetness and coffee taste. i was able to taste my sisters' dirty chai latte, and that was good too! our mini cheesecake was on point with texture and flavor, despite being biased with cheesecake. we didn't get a chance to try anything else because we had dinner prior to stopping by this place. i gotta come back and try out their lunch items too.\n",

      "\n",
      "what i did really like here was the colouring. it was a nice semi-permanent colour, lasted a good while and was applied very well by a different stylist. the price was always pretty reasonable, and roughly the same at each visit.\n",

      "i was needing my hair cut and coloured as i was going to a wedding reception the next day, and wanted to look all pretty! as i already mentioned, i was getting my hair cut in my old hairdressers, but decided to come to urban to get my hair coloured. i trusted them, and knew they were reasonably priced.\n",
      "\n",
      "i was quite keen to go a wee bit lighter and, after a very brief discussion we got going with the colour. now, i am not a hairdresser, i do not understand about foils, semi-permanent, half-heads and all that jargon, i trust that my hairdresser just knows what he's doing! once my hair was washed and blow-dried, it became apparent that something had gone very wrong...think what might happen if some magnolia paint dropped on your head while you were painting and someone dragged a comb through it. it was not good! \n",
      "\n",
      "i mentioned at the time i wasn't happy with it, but was just told it was a bit lighter and i would get use to it! then when i got the till, even with my nhs discount, i was charged double what i usually pay. once i'd picked myself up off the floor, and pointed out it was a huge amount to pay for something i didn't like, i was offered a 'fix it' appointment 6 days later. 6 days later!! that really didn't help me given i was needing to look all pretty for the wedding reception the next day! yelpers, i'm sad to say there were tears!\n",
      "\n",
      "the hairdresser did call back later to say he'd overcharged me anyway, and was due me some money back, but it was little consolation! i did manage to pin the manager down to a chat a few days later, but she wasn't helpful at all, just full of apologies, and even was cheeky enough to suggest that if i thought it was too expensive, i should go for one of their cheaper stylists at my next visit! i happily told her i wouldn't be back! \n",
      "\n",
      "later that day, my next hairdresser told me later there were too many highlights on one side of my hair, and that straight peroxide had been used with no attempt to blend it. he said they were mistakes that an experienced stylist should not have made.\n",

      "in future this salon should ensure everything is explained well to their clients, they are fully aware of prices before the stylist does anything to their hair, and they should aim to put it right as soon as humanly possible. after all, the client might have a wedding to go to and need to look all pretty...without having a wear a hat!\n",

      "now, i used to work in this industry so my experience would be completely different to others...however i would like to make a couple of notes. the girl who cut my hair was lovely, patient and at no time did i feel like i wasn't her main priority...however the best part ( shampoo ) was average, no massage which i look forward to the most and wasn't given any towel to dry soggy ends off on my way back to my chair. i got a great discount as it was my first visit but sadly it will be my last. my cut hasn't been great, it's been a few weeks now and the layers have stayed chunky and disconnected, there isn't symmetry to both sides and i have since taken the scissors to a section that was far longer than the rest... a real shame because i thought i could look past the bad basin work & rest assured my stylist would have me returning.... back to the drawing board!\n",
      "--------\n",
      "if i could give a minus score i most definitely would. i asked for a messy bob, i was aware that my own 'hair cutting' had left mid length layers in my shoulder length hair. this stylist leanne, was shown 2 pictures of bobs, one was messy, one was rounded and slightly tousled. i am a 17yr old girl, and the haircut i was given was one of an '80s power suited businesswoman! she curled it with huge curls, if anyone has seen dharma and greg, the sitcom from the '90s, well, it was when dharma had a bad haircut with curls. \n",

      "apparently, the manager of urban believes in leanne so much that he promoted her. when asked why the bob wasn't given, the manager replied that the pictures only showed the front of the hair, not the back, so it wasn't shown if it was graduated at the back. if this stylist had so much experience and skill, wouldn't she of asked me? and understood that, like the manager said on the 'phone, bobs come in many variations. the stylist did not ask if i wanted a graduated bob, she did however ask if it was ok to cut up to the hair line, i agreed, assuming the bob was taking shape. alas, she thinned it so much, and i didn't see the back of head until after. i was used to a technical hair cut, being shown during the cut the back and sides of the hair (neil bartons)\n",
      "i was so upset when i saw it, and coming home, i was actually crying. my mother came back with me to complain in a civil manner, as i was too nervous. to be met with a man who i thought was a depute manager. he didn't seem to quite understand the problem, and said there was nothing they could do!\n",
      "when my mother rang up, we were offered a credit with another stylist, but as was explained to him, if anyone has had an awful experience at any hair salon, there is no way you would want your hair dealt with again at that particular salon. when my mother explained i was quite shy, the manager sniggered, and i could hear my mother getting impatient. she was very civil until that point. \n",

      "excellent mom\\/pop cafe in the central area in las vegas near unlv. the few times i've been here in the past months have been amazing. the baristas are very engaging and accommodating to your needs. the owners are very passionate with coffee and inventive with their food items that they offer. \n",

      "i found this place randomly about a year ago when i was craving some breakfast food on the way to unlv. just a quick search for \"waffles nearby\" and i came across this lovely gem, and boy, i am glad i did!\n",
      "i've come here often enough for the staff to recognize me and have tried a number of things off their menu (and there's still plenty more to try!). i've recommended this place to people and have brought friends and family here, each trip ending up in a generally positive reaction the the food, atmosphere, and service.\n",
      "the waffles and drinks offered here are numerous and delicious. from savory wafflewiches to sweet treats, theres something for just about anyone. the most popular item amongst the people i've brought here is probably the west coast wafflewich or the bananatella waffles. but if you can't find anything tempting on the menu or can't decide, you're welcome to create your own. and that can be anything--drinks, waffles, sandwiches, salads--if you can think it, they'll make it for you. just to prove it, my boyfriend decided one day that adding chicken to their bananatella would be a great idea (he's an interesting one). and while our server found it an odd request, they fulfilled it anyways. (surprisingly, it didn't turn out that bad!) for the less daring, my personal favorite is a customization as well: the strawberry kisses waffle with bananas, paired with the snickers iced coffee.\n",
      "as for the place itself, the atmosphere is chill and welcoming. they have a nice rotation of music playing and a deck of cards on every table. the furnishings are quirky; tables with mismatched chairs, antique-style lights, and plenty of photographs and waffle-and-pop culture inspired paintings on the walls. it's a perfect place to eat and chat with friends or to catch up on some studying while sipping on some coffee. the servers are nice and friendly, always up to explain the menu and the new, seasonal items they're promoting at the counter (ex. egg nog latte at christmas-time or the pumpkin spice waffle during the fall). the downside is that it gets pretty busy in the small space during peak lunch hours, and service can begin to get slow. the place isn't usually meant for a take-out and run, it's definitely better suited for people willing to sit, eat, and chill.\n",

      "(4\\/5) i got a small pistachio latte because of my love for pistachio ice cream. it did not disappoint in terms of flavor. what brought me here, though, were the pictures of the fun drinks with waffles on them. visual appeal simply makes everything taste better. my latte got defaulted into a to-go cup  even though i was never asked for here or to-go. i'd even set up my spot to study and my drink came after 3 others drinks so there was time to simply glance over and see i was staying (not populated at all, regardless of the three previous orders). so if you come and want a foam design, verbalize that it's for here. \n",

      "4) natural daylight on the top floor; very nice if you have limited exposure to this at home or work\n",
      "5) bathrooms are well maintained, given that some street people like to use them as hygiene stations. on the rare occasion i've reported a problem to staff, they have gotten a housekeeper on it quickly.\n",
      "6) free wi-fi internet access, though it can be quite sluggish at times (too many people streaming video?)\n",

      "10) security makes frequent rounds; i've only seen a couple of \"incidents\" with patrons, and they were handled quickly and efficiently\n",
      "11) large collection of books, though a lot of them seem pretty out of date, almost like cast-offs b-grade stuff from other collections or donations that really don't merit being shelved, especially in the nonfiction materials. at least there is inter-library loan process, though i once tried it and the book i wanted still wasn't available after over a month, so i gave up on it.\n",

      "\n",
      "cons (after several years of attendance):\n",
      "1) water fountains--on the fifth floor, they're pretty much useless due to low pressure. could the library management figure out a way to increase the water pressure up there so i don't have to put my mouth on the spigot to get a drink? 'cause i don't put my mouth on water spigots anywhere, and neither should anybody else.\n",
      "2) i'm average height, but the workstation tabletops on the 5th floor are a little to high for me, and the seats aren't the best, ergonomically speaking. the seats slope backwards: the butt area is way lower than the front edge of the seat, causing me problems with both sciatica and circulation. a flatter seat (with ventilation holes, like those on the 2nd floor) would be welcome. neat chairs but poor ergonomics. :-(\n",
      "3) that lovely view to the north and south is marred by a revolting coating of pigeon poop (especially on the south windows) on the eastern- and western-most panels of the glass. perhaps clean the glass every other month or quarterly, and entice a few of the local raptors to take up residence or nest nearby? fresh pigeon: mmmm!) this is a tourist attraction, so it would be nice to maximize the photo opportunities and minimize the yuck factor for tourists and locals alike.\n",
      "4) second floor has lovely, big tables and chairs on the north end, but no electrical outlets for those tables. it's nice to have a spread-out work environment for a laptop and materials, but you'll only be there as long as your device's battery lasts.\n",
      "5) copier service prices are very high for this day and age, especially given that most of the clientele is clearly not rich\n",
      "6) i guess it's based on demand, but i wish the hours were more consistent from day to day. the sunday short schedule especially is just mean, though i'm sure the employees don't mind it. since this is the main library, i'd hope for 9a-9p hours monday through friday. we can hope, right?\n",

      "the baked goods, i'm a cookie monster with a major sweet tooth... so i sampled half the stuff in their display ... the chocolate chip cookie is a thin crunchy style cookie (not chewy), a yummy cc cookie with a very rich and delicious chocolate taste. and yes, between the 4 of us, we also tried 3 of the scones. . scones can be quite dry and dense at times... but these scones were actually light and moist, but still with that trademark outer texture, you know what i mean? i recommend the chocolate chip and\\/or cranberry orange.. \n",

      "\n",
      "   the ebar place that my mind pictured is different than reality. first off i confused the norman marcus location which is the strip-facing fashion show mall with nordstrom toward the back. the ebar that i visited two times is anything but a speakeasy cafe. in reality the \"e\" in ebar could stand for \"easy\" to find. it is located at the lower level nordstrom's entrance. the sundry of tables on the fashion show mall floor leading into nordstrom's bring attention to the cafe. also, in reality at the time of my visits it is the music permeating the hallway of fashion show mall that is the soundtrack in place of a live piano player. \n",

      "    the ebar is in a hyper-competitive environment for the coffee lover's business. sharing the corridors of fashion show mall are two starbuck's outlets and coffee bean. ebar has an advantage over its competition. it is the honey almond late. they say a bee is attracted to honey. well this includes this busy bee. the first time i tasted their honey almond late, i started to think that the \"e\" in ebar stands for \"excellent\" honey almond late. the ebar honey almond late is up in the troposphere at the level of greatest lates that i have ever drank. that is a compliment coming from somebody who has been to over 300 starbuck's and several coffee shops across the continent. obviously it is close to $5 well spent. \n",
      "\n",
      "     the ebar has more of the ambiance of fashion show mall than its host store nordstrom's. the ebar is a small room to the left of the nordstrom's entrance. in this small room are pastries, beverages, cafe food, and the coffee shop beverages. this is where you order the drinks. where you drink the beverages is technically a corridor of fashion show mall leading into the nordstrom's entrance. there are a sundry of seats in prime people watching territory. also, the complimentary wifi is compliments of fashion show mall and not nordstrom's. \n",
      "\n",
      "      the public check-ins are outstanding advertisements for a business. what makes them even better is that the yelper that visits the business and is happy with a fantastic product such as the honey almond late will write a review that is additional genuine firsthand advertising. in essence this review advertises that ebar serves a honey almond late that is up in the troposphere of one of the greatest lates. ultimately, if there was a late hall of fame, i would induct the ebar honey almond late.\n",

(cause you're not and if you had quit looking at the boobs to make real eye contact you could see the woman you were staring at just wasn't that much into you!) protect tony's investment by talking to the people coming in, people who have no problem paying $25 for membership on the spot. or at least smile and say hi. for a collaboration space i don't think setting the bar at expecting a simple \"hi\" is too much. \n",

      "i came across cakes by leah during a very stressful situation. i had ordered a beautiful cake for my sisters surprise proposal from a great baker. long story short something very tragic happened that my order could not be fulfilled. i started panicking about the dessert i needed to provide for my sisters proposal. i ordered a custom cake from a local bakery in goodyear and when i went to pick it up i was very unsatisfied with the presentation and quality of the cake. i couldn't justify spending a lot of money on something i hated so i had to leave and with only 4 hours left i needed to figure something out. my last resort was going to buy a cake from the frys bakery but i couldn't get myself to purchase an average cake for such a special day. as i sat in the parking lot in tears i started going through yelp desperately looking for a nice bakery that had cakes already made. i came across leah and my day was saved!!!!!! leah told me she didn't have cakes already made but she had alot of fresh baked mini cupcakes in lemon, samoas, almond joy, chocolate, white cake, rum, and other amazing sounding flavors. i believed they were good from reading her yelp reviews. i rushed to meet leah and she welcomed me in her beautiful home with a variety of options to sample. i couldn't have one or two i had to sample them all!!! she even shared a little rum baked treat with me and i'm just standing there amazed at the flavor and quality of these little cupcakes. the best cupcakes i have ever tasted! i promised her she would be my go to cake lady for all my future events. leah has a true talent i'm not lying when i tell you that these cupcakes were a true sensation and a huge hit at my party. they lasted 30 minutes and they disappeared. i regret not buying her entire fridge she had full of cupcakes. you have not tasted a good cupcake until you taste what leah has to offer. look no more i promise you that your life will forever change when you taste leah's amazing cupcakes..... i wouldn't have written this long review if it wasn't worth it. what a blessing it was to find her in the midst of a desperate situation.\n",

(my kingdom for some mujaddara or fuul in this neighborhood!!)  i like that it's a small business, but i think some family drama was going on backstage and it made me feel a little stressed.  i also hope they offer fountain sodas someday, since 20oz bottles are not my fave.  as i was leaving, a 20-seat work lunch arrived, so i'm glad i beat the rush!  looking forward to ordering here often.  :-)\n",

      "behold the library. i'm not that old. in demographer terms i'm a millennial. but i did start going to school before cell phones could fit in a pocket, much less a bag. naturally, the internet wasn't a thing and i typed my earliest reports on an electric typewriter. our first computer had a tube screen and a dot matrix printer that used accordioned paper with perforated edges you could tear off. when i did reports, i went to the library to find books for research. in high school, as the internet became a thing my teachers clutched with false-hopes to their demands that we cite actual books. by the time i made it to college, internet catalogs like jstor, where you can find most scholarly articles at your fingertips in the comfort of your own dorm room or home, were the in-thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "i came to charlotte for college and used the uncc library extensively when i couldn't find a good source on jstor. that's a wonderful library. because of it, i never had the need to sign up for the mecklenburg county library system. after graduating, my need for a library was gone. i joined the working world and never looked back. seven years later my interest in reading rekindled and i started having the insatiable desire to stick my nose in a book. in walks the cmeck library.\n",

      "now that i've finished my personal life story, i'll tell you about this library. it's the location of choice where i signed up to start my new membership. located right off the \"booty loop\", a popular cyclist riding spot, i pass it frequently. it's a super convenient location in a relatively walkable or bikeable area. outside there's a cute garden greeting you as you walk in the door. inside the door there's a rack of magazines and newspapers like endurance and creative loafing. on the counter you can find a regularly updated list of the top ny times best sellers. across from the desk you can find many of these best sellers and other popular books on two small shelves alongside the most recent dvd releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "for the newer dvds there is a very small rental fee of $2 that covers a few days. still better than redbox if you ask me. older dvds come free of charge and we've been using this to rewatch star wars. there are computers available, some desks to work at and comfy chairs to sit in and read. space is quite limited as this is a very small branch library. the selection is also limited but there are still a lot of books coming from a guy who hasn't been in a library in years. the nonfiction is organized by subject (using call numbers) which is a bit confusing to a newcomer like me. the fiction is organized by author last name. there is a young adult section and on the far back side of the library a children's section with ample toys. there are even doors here - lots of good thinkin' went into the design to keep as much noise as possible out of the main area.\n",
      "\n",
      "i use the library's online holds and lists system to keep track of and rate what i've read. it's worlds above what amazon offers for the same. (they tend to favor trying to get you to buy stuff.) the manager of this branch helped me find my way and understand the call number system. she was incredibly considerate, being that i knew jack-diddly! she was actually happy to guide me through, saying she doesn't get to do that often. there are also plenty of opportunities to volunteer. though small, this library feels very cozy and like a hidden gem. every time i come buy i feel like i'm in a sanctuary of fantasy that can pull me out of the stress of the real world. yeah i'll say it, it's like getting lost in a book. literally.\n",

      "\n",
      "problem 3: probably not a major problem but the sheer amount of homeless, loud, or obnoxious people can be startling. despite what the signs would have you believe, there's no such thing as a quiet area. it just wouldn't be a day at toronto reference without hearing someone  yelling across the building or two friends striking up a conversation amidst dulled readers.\n",
